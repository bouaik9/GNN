1,Hindbrain induction and patterning during early vertebrate development,"Dale Frank  1 , ; Dalit Sela-Donenfeld  2; ; ; ","Abstract
The hindbrain is a key relay hub of the central nervous system (CNS), linking the bilaterally symmetric half-sides of lower and upper CNS centers via an extensive network of neural pathways. Dedicated neural assemblies within the hindbrain control many physiological processes, including respiration, blood pressure, motor coordination and different sensations. During early development, the hindbrain forms metameric segmented units known as rhombomeres along the antero-posterior (AP) axis of the nervous system. These compartmentalized units are highly conserved during vertebrate evolution and act as the template for adult brainstem structure and function. TALE and HOX homeodomain family transcription factors play a key role in the initial induction of the hindbrain and its specification into rhombomeric cell fate identities along the AP axis. Signaling pathways, such as canonical-Wnt, FGF and retinoic acid, play multiple roles to initially induce the hindbrain and regulate Hox gene-family expression to control rhombomeric identity. Additional transcription factors including Krox20, Kreisler and others act both upstream and downstream to Hox genes, modulating their expression and protein activity. In this review, we will examine the earliest embryonic signaling pathways that induce the hindbrain and subsequent rhombomeric segmentation via Hox and other gene expression. We will examine how these signaling pathways and transcription factors interact to activate downstream targets that organize the segmented AP pattern of the embryonic vertebrate hindbrain.

Hox transcription factors play fundamental roles during early patterning, but they are also expressed continuously, from embryonic stages through adulthood, in the nervous system. However, the functional significance of their sustained expression remains unclear. In C. elegans motor neurons (MNs), we find that LIN-39 (Scr/Dfd/Hox4-5) is continuously required during post-embryonic life to maintain neurotransmitter identity, a core element of neuronal function. LIN-39 acts directly to co-regulate genes that define cholinergic identity (e.g., unc-17/VAChT, cho-1/ChT). We further show that LIN-39, MAB-5 (Antp/Hox6-8) and the transcription factor UNC-3 (Collier/Ebf) operate in a positive feedforward loop to ensure continuous and robust expression of cholinergic identity genes. Finally, we identify a two-component design principle for homeostatic control of Hox gene expression in adult MNs: Hox transcriptional autoregulation is counterbalanced by negative UNC-3 feedback. These findings uncover a noncanonical role for Hox proteins during post-embryonic life, critically broadening their functional repertoire from early patterning to the control of neurotransmitter identity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36243871/

The Iroquois (Iro/Irx) homeobox genes encode transcription factors with fundamental roles in animal development. Despite their link to various congenital conditions in humans, our understanding of Iro/Irx gene expression, function, and regulation remains incomplete. Here, we conducted a systematic expression analysis of all six mouse Irx genes in the embryonic spinal cord. We found five Irx genes (Irx1, Irx2, Irx3, Irx5, and Irx6) to be confined mostly to ventral spinal domains, offering new molecular markers for specific groups of post-mitotic motor neurons (MNs). Further, we engineered Irx2, Irx5, and Irx6 mouse mutants and uncovered essential but distinct roles for Irx2 and Irx6 in MN development. Last, we found that the highly conserved regulators of MN development across species, the HOX proteins, directly control Irx gene expression both in mouse and C. elegans MNs, critically expanding the repertoire of HOX target genes in the developing nervous system. Altogether, our study provides important insights into Iro/Irx expression and function in the developing spinal cord, and uncovers an ancient gene regulatory relationship between HOX and Iro/Irx genes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38853975/

Multicellular organisms are composed of many tissue types that have distinct morphologies and functions, which are largely driven by specialized proteomes and interactomes. To define the proteome and interactome of a specific type of tissue in an intact animal, we developed a localized proteomics approach called Methionine Analog-based Cell-Specific Proteomics and Interactomics (MACSPI). This method uses the tissue-specific expression of an engineered methionyl-tRNA synthetase to label proteins with a bifunctional amino acid 2-amino-5-diazirinylnonynoic acid in selected cells. We applied MACSPI in Caenorhabditis elegans, a model multicellular organism, to selectively label, capture, and profile the proteomes of the body wall muscle and the nervous system, which led to the identification of tissue-specific proteins. Using the photo-cross-linker, we successfully profiled HSP90 interactors in muscles and neurons and identified tissue-specific interactors and stress-related interactors. Our study demonstrates that MACSPI can be used to profile tissue-specific proteomes and interactomes in intact multicellular organisms.

AT-rich interaction domain 3 (ARID3) transcription factors are expressed in the nervous system, but their mechanisms of action are largely unknown. Here, we provide, in vivo, a genome-wide binding map for CFI-1, the sole C. elegans ARID3 ortholog. We identify 6,396 protein-coding genes as putative direct targets of CFI-1, most of which encode neuronal terminal differentiation markers. In head sensory neurons, CFI-1 directly activates multiple terminal differentiation genes, thereby acting as a terminal selector. In motor neurons, however, CFI-1 acts as a direct repressor, continuously antagonizing three transcriptional activators. By focusing on the glr-4/GRIK4 glutamate receptor locus, we identify proximal CFI-1 binding sites and histone methyltransferase activity as necessary for glr-4 repression. Rescue assays reveal functional redundancy between core and extended DNA-binding ARID domains and a strict requirement for REKLES, the ARID3 oligomerization domain. Altogether, this study uncovers cell-context-dependent mechanisms through which a single ARID3 protein controls the terminal differentiation of distinct neuron types.

Motor activity is organized by neuronal networks composed of motor neurons and a wide variety of pre-motor interneuron populations located in the brainstem and spinal cord. Differential expression and single-cell RNA sequencing studies recently unveiled that these populations subdivide into multiple subsets. However, some interneuron subsets have not been described yet, and the mechanisms contributing to this neuronal diversification have only been partly deciphered. In this study, we aimed to identify additional markers to further describe the diversity of spinal V2 interneuron populations. Here, we compared the transcriptome of V2 interneurons with that of the other cells of the embryonic spinal cord and extracted a list of genes enriched in V2 interneurons, including Arid3c. Arid3c identifies an uncharacterized subset of V2 that partially overlaps with V2c interneurons. These two populations are characterized by the production of Onecut factors and Sox2, suggesting that they could represent a single functional V2 unit. Furthermore, we show that the overexpression or inactivation of Arid3c does not alter V2 production, but its absence results in minor defects in locomotor execution, suggesting a possible function in subtle aspects of spinal locomotor circuit formation.

Terminal selectors are transcription factors that control neuronal identity by regulating expression of key effector molecules, such as neurotransmitter biosynthesis proteins and ion channels. Whether and how terminal selectors control neuronal connectivity is poorly understood. Here, we report that UNC-30 (PITX2/3), the terminal selector of GABA nerve cord motor neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans, is required for neurotransmitter receptor clustering, a hallmark of postsynaptic differentiation. Animals lacking unc-30 or madd-4B, the short isoform of the motor neuron-secreted synapse organizer madd-4 (punctin/ADAMTSL), display severe GABA receptor type A (GABAAR) clustering defects in postsynaptic muscle cells. Mechanistically, UNC-30 acts directly to induce and maintain transcription of madd-4B and GABA biosynthesis genes (e.g. unc-25/GAD, unc-47/VGAT). Hence, UNC-30 controls GABAA receptor clustering in postsynaptic muscle cells and GABA biosynthesis in presynaptic cells, transcriptionally coordinating two crucial processes for GABA neurotransmission. Further, we uncover multiple target genes and a dual role for UNC-30 as both an activator and a repressor of gene transcription. Our findings on UNC-30 function may contribute to our molecular understanding of human conditions, such as Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, caused by PITX2 and PITX3 gene variants.

11,Neurogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans,"Richard J Poole  1 , ; Nuria Flames  2 , ; Luisa Cochella  3; ; ; ; ","Abstract
Animals rely on their nervous systems to process sensory inputs, integrate these with internal signals, and produce behavioral outputs. This is enabled by the highly specialized morphologies and functions of neurons. Neuronal cells share multiple structural and physiological features, but they also come in a large diversity of types or classes that give the nervous system its broad range of functions and plasticity. This diversity, first recognized over a century ago, spurred classification efforts based on morphology, function, and molecular criteria. Caenorhabditis elegans, with its precisely mapped nervous system at the anatomical level, an extensive molecular description of most of its neurons, and its genetic amenability, has been a prime model for understanding how neurons develop and diversify at a mechanistic level. Here, we review the gene regulatory mechanisms driving neurogenesis and the diversification of neuron classes and subclasses in C. elegans. We discuss our current understanding of the specification of neuronal progenitors and their differentiation in terms of the transcription factors involved and ensuing changes in gene expression and chromatin landscape. The central theme that has emerged is that the identity of a neuron is defined by modules of gene batteries that are under control of parallel yet interconnected regulatory mechanisms. We focus on how, to achieve these terminal identities, cells integrate information along their developmental lineages. Moreover, we discuss how neurons are diversified postembryonically in a time-, genetic sex-, and activity-dependent manner. Finally, we discuss how the understanding of neuronal development can provide insights into the evolution of neuronal diversity.

Neuropeptides are abundant signaling molecules that control neuronal activity and behavior in all animals. Owing in part to its well-defined and compact nervous system, Caenorhabditis elegans has been one of the primary model organisms used to investigate how neuropeptide signaling networks are organized and how these neurochemicals regulate behavior. We here review recent work that has expanded our understanding of the neuropeptidergic signaling network in C. elegans by mapping the evolutionary conservation, the molecular expression, the receptor-ligand interactions, and the system-wide organization of neuropeptide pathways in the C. elegans nervous system. We also describe general insights into neuropeptidergic circuit motifs and the spatiotemporal range of peptidergic transmission that have emerged from in vivo studies on neuropeptide signaling. With efforts ongoing to chart peptide signaling networks in other organisms, the C. elegans neuropeptidergic connectome can serve as a prototype to further understand the organization and the signaling dynamics of these networks at organismal level.

Throughout the animal kingdom, several members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family act as proneural genes during early steps of nervous system development. Roles of bHLH genes in specifying terminal differentiation of postmitotic neurons have been less extensively studied. We analyze here the function of five C. elegans bHLH genes, falling into three phylogenetically conserved subfamilies, which are continuously expressed in a very small number of postmitotic neurons in the central nervous system. We show (a) that two orthologs of the vertebrate bHLHb4/b5 genes, called hlh-17 and hlh-32, function redundantly to specify the identity of a single head interneuron (AUA), as well as an individual motor neuron (VB2), (b) that the PTF1a ortholog hlh-13 acts as a terminal selector to control terminal differentiation and function of the sole octopaminergic neuron class in C. elegans, RIC, and (c) that the NHLH1/2 ortholog hlh-15 controls terminal differentiation and function of the peptidergic AVK head interneuron class, a known neuropeptidergic signaling hub in the animal. Strikingly, through null mutant analysis and cell-specific rescue experiments, we find that loss of hlh-15/NHLH in the peptidergic AVK neurons and the resulting abrogation of neuropeptide secretion causes a substantially expanded lifespan of the animal, revealing an unanticipated impact of a central, peptidergic hub neuron in regulating lifespan, which we propose to be akin to hypothalamic control of lifespan in vertebrates. Taken together, our functional analysis reveals themes of bHLH gene function during terminal differentiation that are complementary to the earlier lineage specification roles of other bHLH family members. However, such late functions are much more sparsely employed by members of the bHLH transcription factor family, compared to the function of the much more broadly employed homeodomain transcription factor family.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39071424/

Reliable methods for detecting and analyzing gene expression are necessary tools for understanding development and investigating biological responses to genetic and environmental perturbation. With its fully sequenced genome, invariant cell lineage, transparent body, wiring diagram, detailed anatomy, and wide array of genetic tools, Caenorhabditis elegans is an exceptionally useful model organism for linking gene expression to cellular phenotypes. The development of new techniques in recent years has greatly expanded our ability to detect gene expression at high resolution. Here, we provide an overview of gene expression methods for C. elegans, including techniques for detecting transcripts and proteins in situ, bulk RNA sequencing of whole worms and specific tissues and cells, single-cell RNA sequencing, and high-throughput proteomics. We discuss important considerations for choosing among these techniques and provide an overview of publicly available online resources for gene expression data.

Neurons are remarkably long-lived, non-dividing cells that must maintain their functional features (e.g., electrical properties, chemical signaling) for extended periods of time - decades in humans. How neurons accomplish this incredible feat is poorly understood. Here, we review recent advances, primarily in the nematode C. elegans, that have enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that enable post-mitotic neurons to maintain their functionality across different life stages. We begin with ""terminal selectors"" - transcription factors necessary for the establishment and maintenance of neuronal identity. We highlight new findings on five terminal selectors (CHE-1 [Glass], UNC-3 [Collier/Ebf1-4], LIN-39 [Scr/Dfd/Hox4-5], UNC-86 [Acj6/Brn3a-c], AST-1 [Etv1/ER81]) from different transcription factor families (ZNF, COE, HOX, POU, ETS). We compare the functions of these factors in specific neuron types of C. elegans with the actions of their orthologs in other invertebrate (D. melanogaster) and vertebrate (M. musculus) systems, highlighting remarkable functional conservation. Finally, we reflect on recent findings implicating chromatin-modifying proteins, such as histone methyltransferases and Polycomb proteins, in the control of neuronal terminal identity. Altogether, these new studies on transcription factors and chromatin modifiers not only shed light on the fundamental problem of neuronal identity maintenance, but also outline mechanistic principles of gene regulation that may operate in other long-lived, post-mitotic cell types.

MEIS1 and MEIS2 encode highly conserved homeodomain transcription factors crucial for developmental processes in a wide range of tissues, including the brain. They can execute redundant functions when co-expressed in the same cell types, but their roles during early stages of neural differentiation have not been systematically compared. By separate knockout and overexpression of MEIS1 and MEIS2 in human neural stem cells, we find they control specific sets of target genes, associated with distinct biological processes. Integration of DNA binding sites with differential transcriptomics implicates MEIS1 to co-regulate gene expression by interaction with transcription factors of the SOX and FOX families. MEIS1 harbors the strongest risk factor for restless legs syndrome (RLS). Our data suggest that MEIS1 can directly regulate the RLS-associated genes NTNG1, MDGA1 and DACH1, constituting new approaches to study the elusive pathomechanism or RLS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39578497/

Environmental conditions experienced early in the life of an animal can result in gene expression changes later in its life history. We have previously shown that C. elegans animals that experienced the developmentally arrested and stress resistant dauer stage (postdauers) retain a cellular memory of early-life stress that manifests during adulthood as genome-wide changes in gene expression, chromatin states, and altered life history traits. One consequence of developmental reprogramming in C. elegans postdauer adults is the downregulation of osm-9 TRPV channel gene expression in the ADL chemosensory neurons resulting in reduced avoidance to a pheromone component, ascr#3. This altered response to ascr#3 requires the principal effector of the somatic nuclear RNAi pathway, the Argonaute (AGO) NRDE-3. To investigate the role of the somatic nuclear RNAi pathway in regulating the developmental reprogramming of ADL due to early-life stress, we profiled the mRNA transcriptome of control and postdauer ADL in wild-type and nrde-3 mutant adults. We found 711 differentially expressed (DE) genes between control and postdauer ADL neurons, 90% of which are dependent upon NRDE-3. Additionally, we identified a conserved sequence that is enriched in the upstream regulatory sequences of the NRDE-3-dependent differentially expressed genes. Surprisingly, 214 of the ADL DE genes are considered ""germline-expressed"", including 21 genes encoding the Major Sperm Proteins and two genes encoding the sperm-specific PP1 phosphatases, GSP-3 and GSP-4. Loss of function mutations in gsp-3 resulted in both aberrant avoidance and attraction behaviors. We also show that an AGO pseudogene, Y49F6A.1 (wago-11), is expressed in ADL and is required for ascr#3 avoidance. Overall, our results suggest that small RNAs and reproductive genes program the ADL mRNA transcriptome during their developmental history and highlight a nexus between neuronal and reproductive networks in calibrating animal neuroplasticity.

Electrical coupling is vital to neural communication, facilitating synchronized activity among neurons. Despite its significance, the precise mechanisms governing the establishment of gap junction connections between specific neurons remain elusive. Here, we identified that the PVC interneuron in Caenorhabditis elegans forms gap junction connections with the PVR interneuron. The transcriptional regulator CFI-1 (ARID3) is specifically expressed in the PVC but not PVR interneuron. Reducing cfi-1 expression in the PVC interneuron leads to enhanced gap junction formation in the PVR neuron, while ectopic expression of cfi-1 in the PVR neuron restores the proper level of gap junction connections in the PVC neuron, along with the normal touch response. These findings unveil the pivotal role of CFI-1 in bidirectionally regulating the formation of gap junctions within a specific neuronal pair, shedding light on the intricate molecular mechanisms governing neuronal connectivity in vivo.

However, recent studies have yet to comprehensively reveal the diversity of neurons and the molecular logic of neocortical origin in humans at single-cell resolution through profiling transcriptomic or epigenomic landscapes, owing to the application of unimodal data alone to depict exceedingly heterogeneous populations of neurons. In this study, we generated a comprehensive compendium of the developing human neocortex by simultaneously profiling gene expression and open chromatin from the same cell. We computationally reconstructed the differentiation trajectories of excitatory projection neurons of cortical origin and inferred the regulatory logic governing lineage bifurcation decisions for neuronal diversification. We demonstrated that neuronal diversity arises from progenitor cell lineage specificity and postmitotic differentiation at distinct stages. Our data paves the way for understanding the primarily coordinated regulatory logic for neuronal diversification in the neocortex.

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) affect 4.7% of the global population and are associated with delays in brain development and a spectrum of impairments that can lead to lifelong disability and even mortality. Identification of biomarkers for accurate diagnosis and medications for effective treatment are lacking, in part due to the historical use of preclinical model systems that do not translate well to the clinic for neurological disorders, such as rodents and heterologous cell lines. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are a promising in vitro system for modeling NDDs, providing opportunities to understand mechanisms driving NDDs in human neurons. Functional assays, including patch clamping, multielectrode array, and imaging-based assays, are popular tools employed with hiPSC disease models for disease investigation. Recent progress in machine learning (ML) algorithms also presents unprecedented opportunities to advance the NDD research process. In this review, we compare two-dimensional and three-dimensional hiPSC formats for disease modeling, discuss the applications of functional assays, and offer insights on incorporating ML into hiPSC-based NDD research and drug screening.

During amphibian development, neural patterning occurs via a two-step process. Spemann's organizer secretes BMP antagonists that induce anterior neural tissue. A subsequent caudalizing step re-specifies anterior fated cells to posterior fates such as hindbrain and spinal cord. The neural patterning paradigm suggests that a canonical Wnt-signaling gradient acts along the anteroposterior axis to pattern the nervous system. Wnt activity is highest in the posterior, inducing spinal cord, at intermediate levels in the trunk, inducing hindbrain, and is lowest in anterior fated forebrain, while BMP-antagonist levels are constant along the axis. Our results in Xenopus laevis challenge this paradigm. We find that inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling or its downstream transcription factors eliminates hindbrain, but not spinal cord fates, an observation not compatible with a simple high-to-low Wnt gradient specifying all fates along the neural anteroposterior axis. Additionally, we find that BMP activity promotes posterior spinal cord cell fate formation in an FGF-dependent manner, while inhibiting hindbrain fates. These results suggest a need to re-evaluate the paradigms of neural anteroposterior pattern formation during vertebrate development.

The establishment of anterior-posterior (AP) regional identity is an essential step in the appropriate development of the vertebrate central nervous system. An important aspect of AP neural axis formation is the inherent plasticity that allows developing cells to respond to and recover from the various perturbations that embryos continually face during the course of development. While the mechanisms governing the regionalization of the nervous system have been extensively studied, relatively less is known about the nature and limits of early neural plasticity of the anterior-posterior neural axis. This study aims to characterize the degree of neural axis plasticity in Xenopus laevis by investigating the response of embryos to a 180-degree rotation of their AP neural axis during gastrula stages by assessing the expression of regional marker genes using in situ hybridization. Our results reveal the presence of a narrow window of time between the mid- and late gastrula stage, during which embryos are able undergo significant recovery following a 180-degree rotation of their neural axis and eventually express appropriate regional marker genes including Otx, Engrailed, and Krox. By the late gastrula stage, embryos show misregulation of regional marker genes following neural axis rotation, suggesting that this profound axial plasticity is a transient phenomenon that is lost by late gastrula stages.

Due to the complex structure and function of central nervous system (CNS), human CNS in vitro modeling is still a great challenge. Neurotoxicity testing of environmental chemicals mainly depends on the traditional animal models, which have various limitations such as species differences, expensive and time-consuming. Meanwhile, in vitro two-dimensional (2D) cultured cells or three-dimensional (3D) cultured neurospheres cannot fully simulate complex 3D structure of neural tissues. Recent advancements in neural organoid systems provides excellent models for the testing of environmental chemicals that affect the development of human CNS. Neural organoids derived from hPSCs not only can simulate the process of CNS development, including early stage neural tube formation, neuroepithelium differentiation and regional specification, but also its 3D structure, thus can be used to evaluate the effect of chemicals on differentiation and morphogenesis. Here, we provide a review of recent progress in the methods of culturing neural organoids and their applications in neurotoxicity testing of environmental chemicals. We conclude by highlighting challenge and future directions in neurotoxicity testing based on neural organoids.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe mental illness that can result from neurodevelopmental aberrations, particularly in familial BD, which may include causative genetic variants. In the present study, we derived cortical organoids from BD patients and healthy (control) individuals from a clinically dense family in the Indian population. Our data reveal that the patient organoids show neurodevelopmental anomalies, including organisational, proliferation and migration defects. The BD organoids show a reduction in both the number of neuroepithelial buds/cortical rosettes and the ventricular zone size. Additionally, patient organoids show a lower number of SOX2-positive and EdU-positive cycling progenitors, suggesting a progenitor proliferation defect. Further, the patient neurons show abnormal positioning in the ventricular/intermediate zone of the neuroepithelial bud. Transcriptomic analysis of control and patient organoids supports our cellular topology data and reveals dysregulation of genes crucial for progenitor proliferation and neuronal migration. Lastly, time-lapse imaging of neural stem cells in 2D in vitro cultures reveals abnormal cellular migration in BD samples. Overall, our study pinpoints a cellular and molecular deficit in BD patient-derived organoids and neural stem cell cultures.

Schizophrenia is an often devastating disorder characterized by persistent and idiopathic cognitive deficits, delusions and hallucinations. Schizophrenia has been associated with impaired nervous system development and an excitation/inhibition imbalance in the prefrontal cortex. On a molecular level, schizophrenia is moderately heritable and genetically complex. Hundreds of risk genes have been identified, spanning a heterogeneous landscape dominated by loci that confer relatively small risk. Bioinformatic analyses of genetic associations point to a limited set of neurons, mainly excitatory cortical neurons, but other analyses suggest the importance of astrocytes and microglia. To understand different cell type roles in schizophrenia and reveal novel cell-type specific aetiologically relevant perturbations in schizophrenia, our study integrated genetic analysis with single nucleus RNA-seq of 536,618 nuclei from postmortem samples of dorsal prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 8/9) of 43 cases with schizophrenia and 42 neurotypical controls. We found no significant difference in cell type abundance. Gene expression in excitatory layer 2-3 intra-telencephalic neurons had the greatest number of differentially expressed transcripts and, together with excitatory deep layer intra-telencephalic neurons, conferred most of the genetic risk for schizophrenia. Most differential expression of genes was found in specific cell types and was dominated by down-regulated transcripts. Down-regulated transcripts were enriched in gene sets including transmembrane transport, mitochondrial function, protein folding, and cell-cell signaling whereas up-regulated transcripts were enriched in gene sets related to RNA processing, including RNA splicing in neurons. Co-regulation network analysis identified 40 schizophrenia-relevant programs across 13 cell types. A gene program largely shared between neuronal subtypes, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes was significantly enriched for schizophrenia risk, supporting an aetiological role for perturbed protein modification, ion transport, and mitochondrial function. These results were largely consistent with cell-type expression quantitative trait locus and transcriptome-wide association analyses. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing results, most prominently mitochondrial dysfunction, had multiple points of convergence with proteomic and long-read RNA sequencing results from samples from the same donors.

Neuromesodermal progenitors represent a unique, bipotent population of progenitors residing in the tail bud of the developing embryo, which give rise to the caudal spinal cord cell types of neuroectodermal lineage as well as the adjacent paraxial somite cell types of mesodermal origin. With the advent of stem cell technologies, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), the modeling of rare genetic disorders can be accomplished in vitro to interrogate cell-type specific pathological mechanisms in human patient conditions. Stem cell-derived models of neuromesodermal progenitors have been accomplished by several developmental biology groups; however, most employ a 2D monolayer format that does not fully reflect the complexity of cellular differentiation in the developing embryo. This article presents a dynamic 3D combinatorial method to generate robust populations of human pluripotent stem cell-derived neuromesodermal organoids with multi-cellular fates and regional identities. By utilizing a dynamic 3D suspension format for the differentiation process, the organoids differentiated by following this protocol display a hallmark of embryonic development that involves a morphological elongation known as axial extension. Furthermore, by employing a combinatorial screening assay, we dissect essential pathways for optimally directing the patterning of pluripotent stem cells into neuromesodermal organoids. This protocol highlights the influence of timing, duration, and concentration of WNT and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways on enhancing early neuromesodermal identity, and later, downstream cell fate specification through combined synergies of retinoid signaling and sonic hedgehog activation. Finally, through robust inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway, this protocol accelerates the acquisition of terminal cell identities. This enhanced organoid model can serve as a powerful tool for studying normal developmental processes as well as investigating complex neurodevelopmental disorders, such as neural tube defects. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders that affect the cranial and/or spinal motor neurons (spMNs), spinal sensory neurons and the muscular system. Although they have been investigated for decades, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms; and therefore, efficacious therapies are scarce. Model organisms and relatively simple two-dimensional cell culture systems have been instrumental in our current knowledge of neuromuscular disease pathology; however, in the recent years, human 3D in vitro models have transformed the disease-modeling landscape. While cerebral organoids have been pursued the most, interest in spinal cord organoids (SCOs) is now also increasing. Pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-based protocols to generate SpC-like structures, sometimes including the adjacent mesoderm and derived skeletal muscle, are constantly being refined and applied to study early human neuromuscular development and disease. In this review, we outline the evolution of human PSC-derived models for generating spMN and recapitulating SpC development. We also discuss how these models have been applied to exploring the basis of human neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we provide an overview of the main challenges to overcome in order to generate more physiologically relevant human SpC models and propose some exciting new perspectives.

Nervous system tumors, particularly brain tumors, represent the most common tumors in children and one of the most lethal tumors in adults. Despite decades of research, there are few effective therapies for these cancers. Although human nervous system tumor cells and genetically engineered mouse models have served as excellent platforms for drug discovery and preclinical testing, they have limitations with respect to accurately recapitulating important aspects of the pathobiology of spontaneously arising human tumors. For this reason, attention has turned to the deployment of human stem cell engineering involving human embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells, in which genetic alterations associated with nervous system cancers can be introduced. These stem cells can be used to create self-assembling three-dimensional cerebral organoids that preserve key features of the developing human brain. Moreover, stem cell-engineered lines are amenable to xenotransplantation into mice as a platform to investigate the tumor cell of origin, discover cancer evolutionary trajectories and identify therapeutic vulnerabilities. In this article, we review the current state of human stem cell models of nervous system tumors, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and provide consensus recommendations for future research.

Disordered cellular development, abnormal neuroanatomical formations, and dysfunction of neuronal circuitry are among the pathological manifestations of cortical regions in the brain that are often implicated in complex neurodevelopmental disorders. With the advancement of stem cell methodologies such as cerebral organoid generation, it is possible to study these processes in vitro using 3D cellular platforms that mirror key developmental stages occurring throughout embryonic neurogenesis. Patterning-based stem cell models of directed neuronal development offer one approach to accomplish this, but these protocols often require protracted periods of cell culture to generate diverse cell types and current methods are plagued by a lack of specificity, reproducibility, and temporal control over cell derivation. Although ectopic expression of transcription factors offers another avenue to rapidly generate neurons, this process of direct lineage conversion bypasses critical junctures of neurodevelopment during which disease-relevant manifestations may occur. Here, we present a directed differentiation approach for generating human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cortical organoids with accelerated lineage specification to generate functionally mature cortical neurons in a shorter timeline than previously established protocols. This novel protocol provides precise guidance for the specification of neuronal cell type identity as well as temporal control over the pace at which cortical lineage trajectories are established. Furthermore, we present assays that can be used as tools to interrogate stage-specific developmental signaling mechanisms. By recapitulating major components of embryonic neurogenesis, this protocol allows for improved in vitro modeling of cortical development while providing a platform that can be utilized to uncover disease-specific mechanisms of disordered development at various stages across the differentiation timeline. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Modeling brain development and function is challenging due to complexity of the organ. Human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived brain-like organoids provide new tools to study the human brain. Compared with traditional in vivo toxicological studies, these 3D models, together with 2D cellular assays, enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) during the early stages of neurogenesis and offer numerous advantages including a rapid, cost-effective approach for understanding compound mechanisms and assessing chemical safety. Arsenic (As) exposure is associated with DNT, although the mechanisms involved are not well-defined. Here, we used 3D PSC-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) to recapitulate events involved in embryogenesis and neurogenesis before neural induction, and EB-derived cerebral organoids to mimic neural development in vivo. As (0.5 μM; 35 ppb) increased ectoderm differentiation within the EBs by upregulating genes (PAX6, SOX1) critical for embryonic development. Histological staining of EBs showed As disrupted neural rosette structures. qPCR and RNA-seq showed As inhibited expression of markers of mature neural cells (MAP2+/vGLUT2+) and astrocytes (GFAP+). In organoids, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to identify the top 5 pathways affected by As exposure, and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis found several key signaling pathways to be inhibited by As exposure. These data provide insights into pathways contributing to As-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth and disrupted neural rosette structures in the 2D neurite outgrowth assay and in organoids, respectively. Results herein show this multipronged 2D/3D approach can provide valuable insights into cellular events and molecular mechanisms of As-induced DNT.

Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) are widespread environmental pollutants that pose significant health risks. They originate from industrial processes, consumer products, and environmental degradation, inducing oxidative stress through cellular dysfunctions such as membrane interaction, internalization, mitochondrial damage, inflammation, metal ion leaching, and impaired antioxidant defense. Despite increasing evidence of their toxicity-particularly developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) and mitochondrial impairment-our understanding remains limited due to the high costs of animal studies, which reduce the overall size of experimental data. This underscores the urgent need for alternative test methods that are cost-effective, rapid, and translational. This review examines new approach methodologies (NAMs) for DNT assessment, addressing the ethical, financial, and translational limitations of animal models. NAMs integrate three complementary non-animal models that enhance conventional testing. First, zebrafish models provide organismal insights into behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes at minimal cost. Second, neuronal organoids replicate human-specific neurodevelopmental processes in a 3D system, offering mechanistic insights. Lastly, human cell lines enable high-throughput screening, integrating findings from zebrafish and organoid studies. Establishing a new paradigm for DNT testing is crucial for faster and more efficient toxicity and risk assessments, ultimately protecting public health. Standardizing and gaining regulatory acceptance for NAMs will improve predictive accuracy and broaden their application in environmental toxicology. Advancing these methodologies is essential to addressing the risks of MNP exposure while promoting ethical and sustainable research practices.

Engineered three-dimensional (3D) in vitro and ex vivo neural tissues, also known as ""mini brains and spinal cords in a dish,"" can be derived from different types of human stem cells via several differentiation protocols. In general, human mini brains are micro-scale physiological systems consisting of mixed populations of neural progenitor cells, glial cells, and neurons that may represent key features of human brain anatomy and function. To date, these specialized 3D tissue structures can be characterized into spheroids, organoids, assembloids, organ-on-a-chip and their various combinations based on generation procedures and cellular components. These 3D CNS models incorporate complex cell-cell interactions and play an essential role in bridging the gap between two-dimensional human neuroglial cultures and animal models. Indeed, they provide an innovative platform for disease modeling and therapeutic cell replacement, especially shedding light on the potential to realize personalized medicine for neurological disorders when combined with the revolutionary human induced pluripotent stem cell technology.

Approximately 30% of the veterans who fought in the 1991 Gulf War (GW) suffer from a disease called Gulf War Illness (GWI), which encompasses a constellation of symptoms including cognitive deficits. A coalescence of evidence indicates that GWI was caused by low-level exposure to organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents in combination with physical stressors of the battlefield. Until recently, progress on mechanisms and therapy had been limited to rodent-based models. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from veterans with or without GWI, we recently developed a bank of human induced pluripotent stem cells that can be differentiated into a variety of cellular fates. With these cells, we have now generated cerebral organoids, which are three-dimensional multicellular structures that resemble the human brain. We established organoid cultures from two GW veterans, one with GWI and one without. Immunohistochemical analyses indicate that these organoids, when treated with a GW toxicant regimen consisting of the organophosphate diisopropyl fluorophosphate (a sarin analog) and cortisol (to mimic battlefield stress), display multiple indicators consistent with cognitive deficits, including increased astrocytic reactivity, enhanced phosphorylation of tau proteins, decreased microtubule stability, and impaired neurogenesis. Interestingly, some of these phenotypes were more pronounced in the organoids derived from the veteran with GWI, potentially reflecting a stronger response to the toxicants in some individuals compared to others. These results suggest that veteran-derived human cerebral organoids not only can be used as an innovative human model to uncover the cellular responses to GW toxicants but can also serve as a platform for developing personalized medicine approaches for the veterans.

Despite these strides, challenges in achieving vascularisation and mature neuronal integration persist. The future of SCOs lies in addressing these limitations, potentially leading to transformative impactions in regenerative medicine and therapeutic development.

The benefit of complex 3D models to facilitate the robust testing of new drugs and drug delivery systems during the developmental stages of pharmaceutical manufacturing has recently become distinguished within the field. Recognition of this need by the pharmaceutical industry has provided a motivation for research into the development of reliable complex models for use in drug delivery, biomaterials, and tissue engineering. Both 3D in vitro and ex vivo models can enhance drug-testing and discovery prospects over the more traditionally used 2D, monolayer culture systems and animal models. Despite the widespread acceptance that 3D tissue modelling is advantageous in this field, there remains a lack of standardisation in the models throughout literature. This article provides an extensive review of current literature on in vitro, and ex vivo models of the oral mucosa for drug delivery applications; the advantages, limitations, and recommendations for future development of improved models for this application.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a significant cause of disability worldwide, with limited treatment options. This study investigated the potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) modified with XIST lentiviral vector to modulate macrophage polarization and affect neural stem cell (NSC) microenvironment reconstruction following SCI. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that MID1 might be crucial for BMSCs' treatment of SCI. XIST overexpression enriched Zmynd8 to the promoter region of MID1 and inhibited MID1 transcription, which promoted macrophage M2 polarization. In vitro experiments showed that BMSCs-XIST promoted NSC proliferation, migration, differentiation, and axonal growth by inducing macrophage M2 polarization, suppressing inflammation, and accelerating the re-establishment of the homeostatic microenvironment of NSCs. In vivo, animal experiments confirmed that BMSCs-XIST significantly alleviated SCI by promoting NSC differentiation and axon formation in the injured area. The study demonstrated the potential of XIST-overexpressing BMSCs for treating SCI by regulating macrophage polarization and homeostasis of the NSC microenvironment. These findings provide new insights into the development of stem cell-based therapies for SCI.

Mitochondrial diseases are a group of severe pathologies that cause complex neurodegenerative disorders for which, in most cases, no therapy or treatment is available. These organelles are critical regulators of both neurogenesis and homeostasis of the neurological system. Consequently, mitochondrial damage or dysfunction can occur as a cause or consequence of neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases. As genetic knowledge of neurodevelopmental disorders advances, associations have been identified between genes that encode mitochondrial proteins and neurological symptoms, such as neuropathy, encephalomyopathy, ataxia, seizures, and developmental delays, among others. Understanding how mitochondrial dysfunction can alter these processes is essential in researching rare diseases. Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures, which self-assemble to form specialized structures composed of different cell types, represent an accessible manner to model organogenesis and neurodevelopmental disorders. In particular, brain organoids are revolutionizing the study of mitochondrial-based neurological diseases since they are organ-specific and model-generated from a patient's cell, thereby overcoming some of the limitations of traditional animal and cell models. In this review, we have collected which neurological structures and functions recapitulate in the different types of reported brain organoids, focusing on those generated as models of mitochondrial diseases. In addition to advancements in the generation of brain organoids, techniques, and approaches for studying neuronal structures and physiology, drug screening and drug repositioning studies performed in brain organoids with mitochondrial damage and neurodevelopmental disorders have also been reviewed. This scope review will summarize the evidence on limitations in studying the function and dynamics of mitochondria in brain organoids.

The limitations of traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures and animal testing, when it comes to precisely foreseeing the toxicity and clinical effectiveness of potential drug candidates, have resulted in a notable increase in the rate of failure during the process of drug discovery and development. Three-dimensional (3D) in-vitro models have arisen as substitute platforms with the capacity to accurately depict in-vivo conditions and increasing the predictivity of clinical effects and toxicity of drug candidates. It has been found that 3D models can accurately represent complex tissue structure of human body and can be used for a wide range of disease modeling purposes. Recently, substantial progress in biomedicine, materials and engineering have been made to fabricate various 3D in-vitro models, which have been exhibited better disease progression predictivity and drug effects than convention models, suggesting a promising direction in pharmaceutics. This comprehensive review highlights the recent developments in 3D in-vitro tissue models for preclinical applications including drug screening and disease modeling targeting multiple organs and tissues, like liver, bone, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, heart, brain, and cartilage. We discuss current strategies for fabricating 3D models for specific organs with their strengths and pitfalls. We expand future considerations for establishing a physiologically-relevant microenvironment for growing 3D models and also provide readers with a perspective on intellectual property, industry, and regulatory landscape.

There is a great demand for development of advanced in vitro liver models to predict the efficacy and safety of drug candidates accurately in the preclinical drug development. Despite the great efforts to develop biomimetic models, it remains challenging to precisely mimic a functional unit of the liver (i.e., hepatic lobule) with a continuous microvascular network. Recent progress in laser patterning has allowed us to create arbitrary biomimetic structures with high resolution. Here, we propose an advanced liver-on-chip model mimicking the hepatic lobule with a continuous microvascular network, ranging from the microvessels to the central vein of the liver, utilizing femtosecond laser patterning. Firstly, we optimize the laser power to pattern microchannels mimicking the microvessel and central vein of the hepatic lobule by using a femtosecond laser within a collagen-based hydrogel containing hepatic cells. Secondly, we construct continuous microvessels with luminal structures by comparing different microchannel sizes in diameter. Finally, we assemble a millimeter-scale hepatic lobule-like structure with multiple layers of microvascular networks in the liver-on-chip. Furthermore, our liver-on-chip model exhibits major liver functions and drug-induced hepatotoxicity, as evidenced by albumin and urea productions and by a toxic response to acetaminophen, respectively. Our approach provides valuable strategies for the development of advanced physiological and pathological liver-on-chip models for pharmaceutical and toxicological studies.

The intimate correlation between cardiovascular diseases and other organ pathologies, such as metabolic and kidney diseases, underscores the intricate interactions among these organs. Understanding inter-organ communications is crucial for developing more precise drugs and effective treatments for systemic diseases. While animal models have traditionally been pivotal in studying these interactions, human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer distinct advantages when constructing in vitro models. Beyond the conventional two-dimensional co-culture model, hiPSC-derived humanoid organoids have emerged as a substantial advancement, capable of replicating essential structural and functional attributes of internal organs in vitro. This breakthrough has spurred the development of multilineage organoids, assembloids, and organoids-on-a-chip technologies, which allow for enhanced physiological relevance. These technologies have shown great potential for mimicking coordinated organogenesis, exploring disease pathogenesis, and facilitating drug discovery. As the central organ of the cardiovascular system, the heart serves as the focal point of an extensively studied network of interactions. This review focuses on the advancements and challenges of hiPSC-derived humanoid organoids in studying interactions between the heart and other organs, presenting a comprehensive exploration of this cutting-edge approach in systemic disease research.

Tissue development, function, and disease are largely driven by the spatial organization of individual cells and their cell-cell interactions. Precision engineered tissues with single-cell spatial resolution, therefore, have tremendous potential for next generation disease models, drug discovery, and regenerative therapeutics. Despite significant advancements in biofabrication approaches to improve feature resolution, strategies to fabricate tissues with the exact same organization of individual cells in their native cellular microenvironment have remained virtually non-existent to date. Here we report a method to spatially pattern single cells with up to eight cell phenotypes and subcellular spatial precision. As proof-of-concept we first demonstrate the ability to systematically assess the influence of cellular microenvironments on cell behavior by controllably altering the spatial arrangement of cell types in bioprinted precision cell-cell interaction arrays. We then demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to produce high-fidelity replicas of a patient's annotated cancer biopsy with subcellular resolution. The ability to replicate native cellular microenvironments marks a significant advancement for precision biofabricated in-vitro models, where heterogenous tissues can be engineered with single-cell spatial precision to advance our understanding of complex biological systems in a controlled and systematic manner.

Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide. Previous studies have reported that fucoidan can relieve obesity and hepatic steatosis in vivo, although the molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the effect and potential molecular mechanism of fucoidan in NAFLD using the free fatty acid (FFA)-induced NAFLD spheroid model.
Materials and methods: The spheroids were constructed by fusing the HepG2 and LX-2 cells. Spheroids and HepG2 cells were stimulated with FFAs and fucoidan, then the intracellular lipid contents and the oxidative stress levels (ROS/MDA/GSH/GR/GPx/NQO1/GCLC/HO-1) were detected. Furthermore, the regulation of PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 pathway and the expression of inflammatory factors (TNF-α and IL-6) were measured.
Results: Fucoidan markedly reduced FFA-induced intracellular lipid accumulation in spheroids and HepG2 cells. Notably, fucoidan relieved FFA-induced oxidative stress by reducing the levels of ROS and MDA, and elevating the levels of GSH, GR, and GPx. Furthermore, fucoidan reduced FFA-induced oxidative stress by activating the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway and by inhibiting ROS-induced P65 NF-κB activation and inflammatory responses via Nrf2 pathway activation.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that fucoidan ameliorated FFA-induced lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and NF-κB-mediated inflammation through the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway in the spheroid and HepG2 cells model of NAFLD. These results provided new evidence for the clinical use of fucoidan in the treatment of NAFLD and its potential molecular mechanism of action.

48,Transformation of a neural activation and patterning model,"Arwa Al Anber  1 , ; Benjamin L Martin  1; ; ; ","Abstract
The activation and transformation model of vertebrate nervous system formation posits that neural tissue is initially induced, or activated, with anterior forebrain character. Once established, a subset is then transformed into the more posterior midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord by signals emanating from the posterior of the embryo. This has been a predominant model in the field for decades. In the June issue of EMBO Reports, Polevoy and colleagues evaluate the role of signals thought to act as the neural transforming factors during Xenopus development, and find that while these signals are consistent with the activation transformation model during brain patterning, they do not fit the model with respect to spinal cord formation [1]. This work, along with other recent studies on the origin of the spinal cord, necessitates an updated model of vertebrate nervous system formation, where spinal cord induction and patterning is distinct from that of the brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31338970/
49,Neuromesodermal Lineage Contribution to CNS Development in Invertebrate and Vertebrate Chordates,"Clare Hudson  1 , ; Hitoyoshi Yasuo  1; ; ; ","Abstract
Ascidians are invertebrate chordates and the closest living relative to vertebrates. In ascidian embryos a large part of the central nervous system arises from cells associated with mesoderm rather than ectoderm lineages. This seems at odds with the traditional view of vertebrate nervous system development which was thought to be induced from ectoderm cells, initially with anterior character and later transformed by posteriorizing signals, to generate the entire anterior-posterior axis of the central nervous system. Recent advances in vertebrate developmental biology, however, show that much of the posterior central nervous system, or spinal cord, in fact arises from cells that share a common origin with mesoderm. This indicates a conserved role for bi-potential neuromesoderm precursors in chordate CNS formation. However, the boundary between neural tissue arising from these distinct neural lineages does not appear to be fixed, which leads to the notion that anterior-posterior patterning and neural fate formation can evolve independently.

Tunicates are the sister group to the vertebrates, yet most species have a life cycle split between swimming larva and sedentary adult phases. During metamorphosis, larval neurons are replaced by adult-specific ones. The regulatory mechanisms underlying this replacement remain largely unknown. Using tissue-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in the tunicate Ciona, we show that orthologs of conserved hindbrain and branchiomeric neuron regulatory factors Pax2/5/8 and Phox2 are required to specify the 'neck', a cellular compartment set aside in the larva to give rise to cranial motor neuron-like neurons post-metamorphosis. Using bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses, we characterize the transcriptome of the neck downstream of Pax2/5/8. We present evidence that neck-derived adult ciliomotor neurons begin to differentiate in the larva and persist through metamorphosis, contrary to the assumption that the adult nervous system is formed after settlement and the death of larval neurons during metamorphosis. Finally, we show that FGF signaling during the larval phase alters the patterning of the neck and its derivatives. Suppression of FGF converts neck cells into larval neurons that fail to survive metamorphosis, whereas prolonged FGF signaling promotes an adult neural stem cell-like fate.

Neural epidermal growth factor-like like 2 (NELL2) is a cytoplasmic and secreted glycosylated protein with six epidermal growth factor-like domains. In animal models, NELL2 is predominantly expressed in neural tissues where it regulates neuronal differentiation, polarization, and axon guidance, but little is known about the role of NELL2 in human brain development. In this study, we show that rostral neural stem cells (rNSC) derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) exhibit particularly strong NELL2 expression and that NELL2 protein is enriched at the apical side of neural rosettes in hiPSC-derived brain organoids. Following differentiation of human rostral NSC into neurons, NELL2 remains robustly expressed but changes its subcellular localization from >20 small cytoplasmic foci in NSC to one-five large peri-nuclear puncta per neuron. Unexpectedly, we discovered that in human brain organoids, NELL2 is readily detectable in the oligodendroglia and that the number of NELL2 puncta increases as oligodendrocytes mature. Artificial intelligence-based machine learning further predicts a strong association of NELL2 with multiple human white matter diseases, suggesting that NELL2 may possess yet unexplored roles in regulating oligodendrogenesis and/or myelination during human cortical development and maturation.

54,Mesoderm induction and patterning: Insights from neuromesodermal progenitors,Benjamin L Martin  1; ; ,"Abstract
The discovery of mesoderm inducing signals helped usher in the era of molecular developmental biology, and today the mechanisms of mesoderm induction and patterning are still intensely studied. Mesoderm induction begins during gastrulation, but recent evidence in vertebrates shows that this process continues after gastrulation in a group of posteriorly localized cells called neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs). NMPs reside within the post-gastrulation embryonic structure called the tailbud, where they make a lineage decision between ectoderm (spinal cord) and mesoderm. The majority of NMP-derived mesoderm generates somites, but also contributes to lateral mesoderm fates such as endothelium. The discovery of NMPs provides a new paradigm in which to study vertebrate mesoderm induction. This review will discuss mechanisms of mesoderm induction within NMPs, and how they have informed our understanding of mesoderm induction more broadly within vertebrates as well as animal species outside of the vertebrate lineage. Special focus will be given to the signaling networks underlying NMP-derived mesoderm induction and patterning, as well as emerging work on the significance of partial epithelial-mesenchymal states in coordinating cell fate and morphogenesis.

Neural tube closure in vertebrates is achieved through a highly dynamic and coordinated series of morphogenic events involving neuroepithelium, surface ectoderm, and neural plate border. Failure of this process in the caudal region causes spina bifida. Grainyhead-like 3 (GRHL3) is an indispensable transcription factor for neural tube closure as constitutive inactivation of the Grhl3 gene in mice leads to fully penetrant spina bifida. Here, through single-cell transcriptomics we show that at E8.5, the time-point preceding mouse neural tube closure, co-expression of Grhl3, Tfap2a, and Tfap2c defines a previously unrecognised progenitor population of surface ectoderm integral for neural tube closure. Deletion of Grhl3 expression in this cell population using a Tfap2a-Cre transgene recapitulates the spina bifida observed in Grhl3-null animals. Moreover, conditional inactivation of Tfap2c expression in Grhl3-expressing neural plate border cells also induces spina bifida. These findings indicate that a specific neural plate border cellular cohort is required for the early-stage neurulation.

57,Constructing the pharyngula: Connecting the primary axial tissues of the head with the posterior axial tissues of the tail,"Geneva Masak  1 , ; Lance A Davidson  2; ; ; ","Abstract
The pharyngula stage of vertebrate development is characterized by stereotypical arrangement of ectoderm, mesoderm, and neural tissues from the anterior spinal cord to the posterior, yet unformed tail. While early embryologists over-emphasized the similarity between vertebrate embryos at the pharyngula stage, there is clearly a common architecture upon which subsequent developmental programs generate diverse cranial structures and epithelial appendages such as fins, limbs, gills, and tails. The pharyngula stage is preceded by two morphogenetic events: gastrulation and neurulation, which establish common shared structures despite the occurrence of cellular processes that are distinct to each of the species. Even along the body axis of a singular organism, structures with seemingly uniform phenotypic characteristics at the pharyngula stage have been established by different processes. We focus our review on the processes underlying integration of posterior axial tissue formation with the primary axial tissues that creates the structures laid out in the pharyngula. Single cell sequencing and novel gene targeting technologies have provided us with new insights into the differences between the processes that form the anterior and posterior axis, but it is still unclear how these processes are integrated to create a seamless body. We suggest that the primary and posterior axial tissues in vertebrates form through distinct mechanisms and that the transition between these mechanisms occur at different locations along the anterior-posterior axis. Filling gaps that remain in our understanding of this transition could resolve ongoing problems in organoid culture and regeneration.

The ability to manufacture human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the laboratory holds enormous promise for cellular therapy of human blood diseases. Several differentiation protocols have been developed to facilitate the emergence of HSCs from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Most approaches employ a stepwise addition of cytokines and morphogens to recapitulate the natural developmental process. However, these protocols globally lack clinical relevance and uniformly induce PSCs to produce hematopoietic progenitors with embryonic features and limited engraftment and differentiation capabilities. This review examines how key intrinsic cues and extrinsic environmental inputs have been integrated within human PSC differentiation protocols to enhance the emergence of definitive hematopoiesis and how advances in genomics set the stage for imminent breakthroughs in this field.

Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are a vertebrate cell type that contribute descendants to both the spinal cord and the mesoderm. The undifferentiated bipotential NMP state is maintained when both Wnt signaling is active and Sox2 is present. We used transgenic reporter lines to live-image both Wnt activity and Sox2 levels in NMPs and observed a unique cellular ratio in NMPs compared to NMP-derived mesoderm or neural tissue. We used this unique signature to identify the previously unknown anatomical position of a progenitor population that gives rise to the midline tissues of the floor plate of the spinal cord and the mesodermal notochord. Thus, quantification of the active Wnt signaling to Sox2 ratio can be used to predict and identify cells with neuromesodermal potential. We also developed the auxin inducible degron 2 system for use in zebrafish to test the temporal role that Sox2 plays during midline formation. We found ectopic Sox2 in the presence of Wnt activity holds cells in the undifferentiated floor plate/notochord progenitor state, and that degradation of the ectopic Sox2 is required for cells to adopt a notochord fate.

The establishment of anterior-posterior (AP) regional identity is an essential step in the appropriate development of the vertebrate central nervous system. An important aspect of AP neural axis formation is the inherent plasticity that allows developing cells to respond to and recover from the various perturbations that embryos continually face during the course of development. While the mechanisms governing the regionalization of the nervous system have been extensively studied, relatively less is known about the nature and limits of early neural plasticity of the anterior-posterior neural axis. This study aims to characterize the degree of neural axis plasticity in Xenopus laevis by investigating the response of embryos to a 180-degree rotation of their AP neural axis during gastrula stages by assessing the expression of regional marker genes using in situ hybridization. Our results reveal the presence of a narrow window of time between the mid- and late gastrula stage, during which embryos are able undergo significant recovery following a 180-degree rotation of their neural axis and eventually express appropriate regional marker genes including Otx, Engrailed, and Krox. By the late gastrula stage, embryos show misregulation of regional marker genes following neural axis rotation, suggesting that this profound axial plasticity is a transient phenomenon that is lost by late gastrula stages.

61,From Endoderm to Progenitors: An Update on the Early Steps of Thyroid Morphogenesis in the Zebrafish,"Federica Marelli  1   2 , ; Giuditta Rurale  1 , ; Luca Persani  1   2; ; ; ; ","Abstract
The mechanisms underlying thyroid gland development have a central interest in biology and this review is aimed to provide an update on the recent advancements on the early steps of thyroid differentiation that were obtained in the zebrafish, because this teleost fish revealed to be a suitable organism to study the early developmental stages. Physiologically, the thyroid precursors fate is delineated by the appearance among the endoderm cells of the foregut of a restricted cell population expressing specific transcription factors, including pax2a, nkx2.4b, and hhex. The committed thyroid primordium first appears as a thickening of the pharyngeal floor of the anterior endoderm, that subsequently detaches from the floor and migrates to its final location where it gives rise to the thyroid hormone-producing follicles. At variance with mammalian models, thyroid precursor differentiation in zebrafish occurs early during the developmental process before the dislocation to the eutopic positioning of thyroid follicles. Several pathways have been implicated in these early events and nowadays there is evidence of a complex crosstalk between intrinsic (coming from the endoderm and thyroid precursors) and extrinsic factors (coming from surrounding tissues, as the cardiac mesoderm) whose organization in time and space is probably required for the proper thyroid development. In particular, Notch, Shh, Fgf, Bmp, and Wnt signaling seems to be required for the commitment of endodermal cells to a thyroid fate at specific developmental windows of zebrafish embryo. Here, we summarize the recent findings produced in the various zebrafish experimental models with the aim to define a comprehensive picture of such complicated puzzle.

The pathogenesis of thyroid dysgenesis (TD) is not well understood. Here, using a combination of single-cell RNA and spatial transcriptome sequencing, we identify a subgroup of NF-κB-activated thyrocytes located at the center of thyroid tissues in postnatal mice, which maintained a partially mesenchymal phenotype. These cells actively protruded out of the thyroid primordium and generated new follicles in zebrafish embryos through continuous tracing. Suppressing NF-κB signaling affected thyrocyte migration and follicle formation, leading to a TD-like phenotype in both mice and zebrafish. Interestingly, during thyroid folliculogenesis, myeloid cells played a crucial role in promoting thyrocyte migration by maintaining close contact and secreting TNF-α. We found that cebpa mutant zebrafish, in which all myeloid cells were depleted, exhibited thyrocyte migration defects. Taken together, our results suggest that myeloid-derived TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation plays a critical role in promoting the migration of vertebrate thyrocytes for follicle generation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38057310/

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), characterized by the non-malignant enlargement of the prostate, exhibits a pronounced association with inflammation resulting from androgen receptor (AR) deficiency. Ferroptosis, a cell death mechanism triggered by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and closely linked to inflammation, has yet to be fully understood in the context of BPH. Using RNA sequencing, we observed a significant elevation of taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in BPH tissues compared to normal prostate tissue. High levels of TUG1 exhibited a discernible correlation with both prostate volume and the extent of inflammatory infiltration in BPH patients. The suppression of TUG1 not only led to a reduction in prostate size but also ameliorated AR-deficiency-induced prostatic hyperplasia. Mechanistically, a decrease in AR in prostate luminal cells prompted macrophage aggregation and the release of IL-1β, subsequently fostering the transcription of TUG1 via MYC. Induced TUG1, through competitive binding with miR-188-3p, facilitated the expression of GPX4, thereby diminishing intracellular ROS levels and impeding ferroptosis in prostate luminal cells. Notably, the ferroptosis inducer JKE-1674 alleviated inflammation-induced prostatic hyperplasia in vivo. Together, these findings suggest that AR deficiency crucially inhibits ferroptosis, promoting BPH via the TUG1/miR-188-3p/GPX4 signaling axis, and making ferroptosis induction a promising therapeutic strategy for BPH patients with AR deficiency.

The mechanisms of bifurcation, a key step in thyroid development, are largely unknown. Here we find three zebrafish lines from a forward genetic screening with similar thyroid dysgenesis phenotypes and identify a stop-gain mutation in hgfa and two missense mutations in met by positional cloning from these zebrafish lines. The elongation of the thyroid primordium along the pharyngeal midline was dramatically disrupted in these zebrafish lines carrying a mutation in hgfa or met. Further studies show that MAPK inhibitor U0126 could mimic thyroid dysgenesis in zebrafish, and the phenotypes are rescued by overexpression of constitutively active MEK or Snail, downstream molecules of the HGF/Met pathway, in thyrocytes. Moreover, HGF promotes thyrocyte migration, which is probably mediated by downregulation of E-cadherin expression. The delayed bifurcation of the thyroid primordium is also observed in thyroid-specific Met knockout mice. Together, our findings reveal that HGF/Met is indispensable for the bifurcation of the thyroid primordium during thyroid development mediated by downregulation of E-cadherin in thyrocytes via MAPK-snail pathway.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38605010/
65,Ethanol Induces Craniofacial Defects in Bmp Mutants Independent of nkx2.3 by Elevating Cranial Neural Crest Cell Apoptosis,"Hieu D L Vo  1 , ; C Ben Lovely  1; ; ; ","Abstract
Background: Craniofacial malformations lie at the heart of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). While there is growing evidence for a genetic component in FASDs, little is known of the cellular mechanisms underlying these ethanol-sensitive loci in facial development. The bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling pathway-dependent endoderm pouch formation is a key mechanism in facial development. We have previously shown that multiple Bmp mutants are sensitized to ethanol-induced facial defects. However, ethanol does not directly impact Bmp signaling. This suggests that downstream effectors, like nkx2.3, may mediate the impact of ethanol on Bmp mutants. Methods: We use an ethanol exposure paradigm with nkx2.3 knockdown approaches to test if nkx2.3 loss sensitizes Bmp mutants to ethanol-induced facial defects. We combine morphometric approaches with immunofluorescence and a hybridization chain reaction to examine the cellular mechanisms underlying Bmp-ethanol interactions. Results: We show that Bmp-ethanol interactions alter the morphology of the endodermal pouches, independent of nkx2.3 gene expression. Knockdown of nkx2.3 does not sensitize wild-type or Bmp mutants to ethanol-induced facial defects. However, we did observe a significant increase in CNCC apoptosis in ethanol-treated Bmp mutants, suggesting an ethanol sensitive, Bmp-dependent signaling pathway driving tissue interactions at the heart of FASDs. Conclusions: Collectively, our work builds on the mechanistic understanding of ethanol-sensitive genes and lays the groundwork for complex multi-tissue signaling events that have yet to be explored. Ultimately, our work provides a mechanistic paradigm of ethanol-induced facial defects and connects ethanol exposure with complex tissue signaling events that drive development.

66,Short-Term Exposure Effects of the Environmental Endocrine Disruptor Benzo(a)Pyrene on Thyroid Axis Function in Zebrafish,"Giuditta Rurale  1 , ; Ilaria Gentile  2 , ; Camilla Carbonero  2 , ; Luca Persani  1   2 , ; Federica Marelli  1; ; ; ; ; ; ","Abstract
Benzo(a)Pyrene (BaP) is one of the most widespread polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with endocrine disrupting properties and carcinogenic effects. In the present study, we tested the effect of BaP on thyroid development and function, using zebrafish as a model system. Zebrafish embryos were treated with 50 nM BaP from 2.5 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf) and compared to 1.2% DMSO controls. The expression profiles of markers of thyroid primordium specification, thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis, hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, TH transport and metabolism, and TH action were analyzed in pools of treated and control embryos at different developmental stages. BaP treatment did not affect early markers of thyroid differentiation but resulted in a significant decrease of markers of TH synthesis (tg and nis) likely secondary to defective expression of the central stimulatory hormones of thyroid axis (trh, tshba) and of TH metabolism (dio2). Consequently, immunofluorescence of BaP treated larvae showed a low number of follicles immunoreactive to T4. In conclusion, our results revealed that the short-term exposure to BaP significantly affects thyroid function in zebrafish, but the primary toxic effects would be exerted at the hypothalamic-pituitary level thus creating a model of central hypothyroidism.

Objective: To identify key pathological hub genes, micro RNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) of osteoporosis (OP) and construct their ceRNA network in an effort to explore the potential biomarkers and drug targets for OP therapy.
Methods: GSE7158, GSE201543, and GSE161361 microarray datasets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing OP patients with healthy controls and hub genes were screened by machine learning algorithms. Target miRNAs and circRNAs were predicted by FunRich and circbank, then ceRNA network were constructed by Cytoscape. Pathways affecting OP were identified by functional enrichment analysis. The hub genes were verified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Potential drug molecules related to OP were predicted by DSigDB database and molecular docking was analyzed by autodock vina software.
Results: A total of 179 DEGs were identified. By combining three machine learning algorithms, BAG2, MME, SLC14A1, and TRIM44 were identified as hub genes. Three OP-associated target miRNAs and 362 target circRNAs were predicted to establish ceRNA network. The ROC curves showed that these four hub genes had good diagnostic performance and their differential expression was statistically significant in OP animal model. Benzo[a]pyrene was predicted which could successfully bind to protein receptors related to the hub genes and it was served as the potential drug molecules.
Conclusion: An mRNA-miRNA-circRNA network is reported, which provides new ideas for exploring the pathogenesis of OP. Benzo[a]pyrene, as potential drug molecules for OP, may provide guidance for the clinical treatment.

Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is considered a common endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) with mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. In this work, we evaluated the effects of BaP on the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) of zebrafish embryos. The embryos were treated with 5 and 50 nM BaP from 2.5 to 72 hours post-fertilization (hpf) and obtained data were compared with those from controls. We followed the entire development of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH3) neurons that start to proliferate from the olfactory region at 36 hpf, migrate at 48 hpf and then reach the pre-optic area and the hypothalamus at 72 hpf. Interestingly, we observed a compromised neuronal architecture of the GnRH3 network after the administration of 5 and 50 nM BaP. Given the toxicity of this compound, we evaluated the expression of genes involved in antioxidant activity, oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis and we found an upregulation of these pathways. Consequently, we performed a TUNEL assay and we confirmed an increment of cell death in brain of embryos treated with BaP. In conclusion our data reveal that short-term exposure of zebrafish embryos to BaP affects GnRH3 development likely through a neurotoxic mechanism.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are ubiquitous air pollutants, with additional widespread exposure in the diet. PAH exposure has been linked to adverse birth outcomes and long-term neurological consequences. To understand genetic differences that could affect susceptibility following developmental exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, we exposed mice with variations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and the three CYP1 enzymes from gestational day 10 (G10) to weaning at postnatal day 25 (P25). We found unexpectedly high neonatal lethality in high-affinity AhrbCyp1b1(-/-) knockout mice compared with all other genotypes. Over 60% of BaP-exposed pups died within their first 5 days of life. There was a significant effect of BaP on growth rates in surviving pups, with lower weights observed from P7 to P21. Again, AhrbCyp1b1(-/-) knockout mice were the most susceptible to growth retardation. Independent of treatment, this line of mice also had impaired development of the surface righting reflex. We used high-resolution mass spectrometry to measure BaP and metabolites in tissues from both dams and pups. We found the highest BaP levels in adipose from poor-affinity AhrdCyp1a2(-/-) dams and identified three major BaP metabolites (BaP-7-OH, BaP-9-OH, and BaP-4,5-diol), but our measurements were limited to a single time point. Future work is needed to understand BaP pharmacokinetics in the contexts of gestation and lactation and how differential metabolism leads to adverse developmental outcomes.

Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) are widespread environmental pollutants and can destroy thyroid function. We assessed the biochemical changes in the thyroid tissue of rats exposed to B[a]P and BDE-47 using attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy combined with support vector machine(SVM). After B[a]P and BDE-47 treatment in rats, the structure of thyroid follicles was destroyed and epithelial cells were necrotic, indicating that B[a]P and BDE-47 may lead to changes of the thyroid morphology of the rats. These damages are mainly related to C=O stretch vibrations of lipids (1743 cm-1), as well as the secondary structure of proteins [amide I (1645 cm-1) and amide II (1550 cm-1)], and carbohydrates [C-OH (1138 cm-1), C-O (1106 cm-1, 1049 cm-1, 991 cm-1), C-C (1106 cm-1) stretching] and collagen (phosphodiester stretching at 922 cm-1) vibration modes. When SVM was used for classification, there was a substantial separation between the control and the exposure groups (accuracy = 96%; sensitivity = 98%; specificity = 87%), and there was also a major separation between the exposed groups (accuracy = 93%; sensitivity = 94%; and specificity = 92%).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38313510/

72,Neuromesodermal Lineage Contribution to CNS Development in Invertebrate and Vertebrate Chordates,"Clare Hudson  1 , ; Hitoyoshi Yasuo  1; ; ; ","Abstract
Ascidians are invertebrate chordates and the closest living relative to vertebrates. In ascidian embryos a large part of the central nervous system arises from cells associated with mesoderm rather than ectoderm lineages. This seems at odds with the traditional view of vertebrate nervous system development which was thought to be induced from ectoderm cells, initially with anterior character and later transformed by posteriorizing signals, to generate the entire anterior-posterior axis of the central nervous system. Recent advances in vertebrate developmental biology, however, show that much of the posterior central nervous system, or spinal cord, in fact arises from cells that share a common origin with mesoderm. This indicates a conserved role for bi-potential neuromesoderm precursors in chordate CNS formation. However, the boundary between neural tissue arising from these distinct neural lineages does not appear to be fixed, which leads to the notion that anterior-posterior patterning and neural fate formation can evolve independently.

Tunicates are the sister group to the vertebrates, yet most species have a life cycle split between swimming larva and sedentary adult phases. During metamorphosis, larval neurons are replaced by adult-specific ones. The regulatory mechanisms underlying this replacement remain largely unknown. Using tissue-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in the tunicate Ciona, we show that orthologs of conserved hindbrain and branchiomeric neuron regulatory factors Pax2/5/8 and Phox2 are required to specify the 'neck', a cellular compartment set aside in the larva to give rise to cranial motor neuron-like neurons post-metamorphosis. Using bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses, we characterize the transcriptome of the neck downstream of Pax2/5/8. We present evidence that neck-derived adult ciliomotor neurons begin to differentiate in the larva and persist through metamorphosis, contrary to the assumption that the adult nervous system is formed after settlement and the death of larval neurons during metamorphosis. Finally, we show that FGF signaling during the larval phase alters the patterning of the neck and its derivatives. Suppression of FGF converts neck cells into larval neurons that fail to survive metamorphosis, whereas prolonged FGF signaling promotes an adult neural stem cell-like fate.

74,"Gene networks and the evolution of olfactory organs, eyes, hair cells and motoneurons: a view encompassing lancelets, tunicates and vertebrates","Bernd Fritzsch  1 , ; Joel C Glover  2   3; ; ; ","Abstract
Key developmental pathways and gene networks underlie the formation of sensory cell types and structures involved in chemosensation, vision and mechanosensation, and of the efferents these sensory inputs can activate. We describe similarities and differences in these pathways and gene networks in selected species of the three main chordate groups, lancelets, tunicates, and vertebrates, leading to divergent development of olfactory receptors, eyes, hair cells and motoneurons. The lack of appropriately posited expression of certain transcription factors in lancelets and tunicates prevents them from developing vertebrate-like olfactory receptors and eyes, although they generate alternative structures for chemosensation and vision. Lancelets and tunicates lack mechanosensory cells associated with the sensation of acoustic stimuli, but have gravisensitive organs and ciliated epidermal sensory cells that may (and in some cases clearly do) provide mechanosensation and thus the capacity to respond to movement relative to surrounding water. Although functionally analogous to the vertebrate vestibular apparatus and lateral line, homology is questionable due to differences in the expression of the key transcription factors Neurog and Atoh1/7, on which development of vertebrate hair cells depends. The vertebrate hair cell-bearing inner ear and lateral line thus likely represent major evolutionary advances specific to vertebrates. Motoneurons develop in vertebrates under the control of the ventral signaling molecule hedgehog/sonic hedgehog (Hh,Shh), against an opposing inhibitory effect mediated by dorsal signaling molecules. Many elements of Shh-signaling and downstream genes involved in specifying and differentiating motoneurons are also exhibited by lancelets and tunicates, but the repertoire of MNs in vertebrates is broader, indicating greater diversity in motoneuron differentiation programs.

76,Mesoderm induction and patterning: Insights from neuromesodermal progenitors,Benjamin L Martin  1; ; ,"Abstract
The discovery of mesoderm inducing signals helped usher in the era of molecular developmental biology, and today the mechanisms of mesoderm induction and patterning are still intensely studied. Mesoderm induction begins during gastrulation, but recent evidence in vertebrates shows that this process continues after gastrulation in a group of posteriorly localized cells called neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs). NMPs reside within the post-gastrulation embryonic structure called the tailbud, where they make a lineage decision between ectoderm (spinal cord) and mesoderm. The majority of NMP-derived mesoderm generates somites, but also contributes to lateral mesoderm fates such as endothelium. The discovery of NMPs provides a new paradigm in which to study vertebrate mesoderm induction. This review will discuss mechanisms of mesoderm induction within NMPs, and how they have informed our understanding of mesoderm induction more broadly within vertebrates as well as animal species outside of the vertebrate lineage. Special focus will be given to the signaling networks underlying NMP-derived mesoderm induction and patterning, as well as emerging work on the significance of partial epithelial-mesenchymal states in coordinating cell fate and morphogenesis.

77,Constructing the pharyngula: Connecting the primary axial tissues of the head with the posterior axial tissues of the tail,"Geneva Masak  1 , ; Lance A Davidson  2; ; ; ","Abstract
The pharyngula stage of vertebrate development is characterized by stereotypical arrangement of ectoderm, mesoderm, and neural tissues from the anterior spinal cord to the posterior, yet unformed tail. While early embryologists over-emphasized the similarity between vertebrate embryos at the pharyngula stage, there is clearly a common architecture upon which subsequent developmental programs generate diverse cranial structures and epithelial appendages such as fins, limbs, gills, and tails. The pharyngula stage is preceded by two morphogenetic events: gastrulation and neurulation, which establish common shared structures despite the occurrence of cellular processes that are distinct to each of the species. Even along the body axis of a singular organism, structures with seemingly uniform phenotypic characteristics at the pharyngula stage have been established by different processes. We focus our review on the processes underlying integration of posterior axial tissue formation with the primary axial tissues that creates the structures laid out in the pharyngula. Single cell sequencing and novel gene targeting technologies have provided us with new insights into the differences between the processes that form the anterior and posterior axis, but it is still unclear how these processes are integrated to create a seamless body. We suggest that the primary and posterior axial tissues in vertebrates form through distinct mechanisms and that the transition between these mechanisms occur at different locations along the anterior-posterior axis. Filling gaps that remain in our understanding of this transition could resolve ongoing problems in organoid culture and regeneration.

Neural tube closure in vertebrates is achieved through a highly dynamic and coordinated series of morphogenic events involving neuroepithelium, surface ectoderm, and neural plate border. Failure of this process in the caudal region causes spina bifida. Grainyhead-like 3 (GRHL3) is an indispensable transcription factor for neural tube closure as constitutive inactivation of the Grhl3 gene in mice leads to fully penetrant spina bifida. Here, through single-cell transcriptomics we show that at E8.5, the time-point preceding mouse neural tube closure, co-expression of Grhl3, Tfap2a, and Tfap2c defines a previously unrecognised progenitor population of surface ectoderm integral for neural tube closure. Deletion of Grhl3 expression in this cell population using a Tfap2a-Cre transgene recapitulates the spina bifida observed in Grhl3-null animals.

79,De Novo Generation of Human Hematopoietic Stem Cells from Pluripotent Stem Cells for Cellular Therapy,"Jianyi Ding  1 , ; Yongqin Li  1 , ; Andre Larochelle  1; ; ; ; ","Abstract
The ability to manufacture human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the laboratory holds enormous promise for cellular therapy of human blood diseases. Several differentiation protocols have been developed to facilitate the emergence of HSCs from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Most approaches employ a stepwise addition of cytokines and morphogens to recapitulate the natural developmental process. However, these protocols globally lack clinical relevance and uniformly induce PSCs to produce hematopoietic progenitors with embryonic features and limited engraftment and differentiation capabilities. This review examines how key intrinsic cues and extrinsic environmental inputs have been integrated within human PSC differentiation protocols to enhance the emergence of definitive hematopoiesis and how advances in genomics set the stage for imminent breakthroughs in this field.

Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are a vertebrate cell type that contribute descendants to both the spinal cord and the mesoderm. The undifferentiated bipotential NMP state is maintained when both Wnt signaling is active and Sox2 is present. We used transgenic reporter lines to live-image both Wnt activity and Sox2 levels in NMPs and observed a unique cellular ratio in NMPs compared to NMP-derived mesoderm or neural tissue. We used this unique signature to identify the previously unknown anatomical position of a progenitor population that gives rise to the midline tissues of the floor plate of the spinal cord and the mesodermal notochord. Thus, quantification of the active Wnt signaling to Sox2 ratio can be used to predict and identify cells with neuromesodermal potential. We also developed the auxin inducible degron 2 system for use in zebrafish to test the temporal role that Sox2 plays during midline formation. We found ectopic Sox2 in the presence of Wnt activity holds cells in the undifferentiated floor plate/notochord progenitor state, and that degradation of the ectopic Sox2 is required for cells to adopt a notochord fate.

81,Ascidian embryonic cells with properties of neural-crest cells and neuromesodermal progenitors of vertebrates,"Tasuku Ishida  1 , ; Yutaka Satou  2; ; ; ","Abstract
Neural-crest cells and neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are multipotent cells that are important for development of vertebrate embryos. In embryos of ascidians, which are the closest invertebrate relatives of vertebrates, several cells located at the border between the neural plate and the epidermal region have neural-crest-like properties; hence, the last common ancestor of ascidians and vertebrates may have had ancestral cells similar to neural-crest cells. However, these ascidian neural-crest-like cells do not produce cells that are commonly of mesodermal origin. Here we showed that a cell population located in the lateral region of the neural plate has properties resembling those of vertebrate neural-crest cells and NMPs. Among them, cells with Tbx6-related expression contribute to muscle near the tip of the tail region and cells with Sox1/2/3 expression give rise to the nerve cord. These observations and cross-species transcriptome comparisons indicate that these cells have properties similar to those of NMPs. Meanwhile, transcription factor genes Dlx.b, Zic-r.b and Snai, which are reminiscent of a gene circuit in vertebrate neural-crest cells, are involved in activation of Tbx6-related.b. Thus, the last common ancestor of ascidians and vertebrates may have had cells with properties of neural-crest cells and NMPs and such ancestral cells may have produced cells commonly of ectodermal and mesodermal origins.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38565680/

Neural crest cells are multipotent progenitors that produce defining features of vertebrates such as the 'new head'1. Here we use the tunicate, Ciona, to explore the evolutionary origins of neural crest since this invertebrate chordate is among the closest living relatives of vertebrates2-4. Previous studies identified two potential neural crest cell types in Ciona, sensory pigment cells and bipolar tail neurons5,6. Recent findings suggest that bipolar tail neurons are homologous to cranial sensory ganglia rather than derivatives of neural crest7,8. Here we show that the pigment cell lineage also produces neural progenitor cells that form regions of the juvenile nervous system following metamorphosis. Neural progenitors are also a major derivative of neural crest in vertebrates, suggesting that the last common ancestor of tunicates and vertebrates contained a multipotent progenitor population at the neural plate border. It would therefore appear that a key property of neural crest, multipotentiality, preceded the emergence of vertebrates.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39443803/

Nanoplastics pose a growing threat to marine ecosystems, particularly affecting the early developmental stages of marine organisms. This study investigates the effects of amino-modified polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NH2, 50 nm) on the embryonic development of Phallusia mammillata, a model ascidian species. Both chorionated and dechorionated embryos were exposed to increasing concentrations of PS-NH2 so morphological alterations could be assessed with a high-content analysis of the phenotypes and genotoxicity. PS-NH2 induced the same morphological alterations in both chorionated and dechorionated embryos, with dechorionated embryos being more sensitive (EC50 = 3.0 μg mL-1) than chorionated ones (EC50 = 6.26 μg mL-1). Interestingly, results from the morphological analysis showed two concentration-dependent mechanisms of action: (i) at concentrations near the EC50, neurodevelopmental abnormalities resembling the ones induced by exposure to known endocrine disruptors (EDs) were observed, and (ii) at higher concentrations (15 μg mL-1 and 7.5 μg mL-1 for chorionated and dechorionated embryos, respectively), a nonspecific toxicity was evident, likely due to general oxidative stress. The phenotypes resulting from the PS-NH2 treatment were not related to DNA damage, as revealed by a genotoxicity assay performed on neurula embryos. Our data suggest that PS-NH2-induced toxicity is primarily mediated through oxidative stress, probably triggered by interactions between the positive charges of the PS NPs and the negative charges on the cell membranes. The lack of a protective chorion further exacerbated these effects, highlighting its role in mitigating/protecting against NP-induced damage.

84,Making sense of vertebrate senses from a neural crest and cranial placode evo-devo perspective,"Brittany M Edens  1 , ; Marianne E Bronner  2; ; ; ","Abstract
The evolution of vertebrates from protochordate ancestors marked the beginning of the gradual transition to predatory lifestyles. Enabled by the acquisition of multipotent neural crest and cranial placode cell populations, vertebrates developed an elaborate peripheral nervous system, equipped with paired sense organs, which aided in adaptive behaviors and ultimately, successful colonization of diverse environmental niches. Underpinning the enduring success of vertebrates is the highly adaptable nature of the peripheral nervous system, which is enabled by the exceptional malleability of the neural crest and placode developmental programs. Here, we explore the embryonic origins of the vertebrate senses from the neural crest and cranial placodes and discuss the evolutionary trajectory of the senses in the context of adaptation to novel environments.

Neural epidermal growth factor-like like 2 (NELL2) is a cytoplasmic and secreted glycosylated protein with six epidermal growth factor-like domains. In animal models, NELL2 is predominantly expressed in neural tissues where it regulates neuronal differentiation, polarization, and axon guidance, but little is known about the role of NELL2 in human brain development. In this study, we show that rostral neural stem cells (rNSC) derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) exhibit particularly strong NELL2 expression and that NELL2 protein is enriched at the apical side of neural rosettes in hiPSC-derived brain organoids. Following differentiation of human rostral NSC into neurons, NELL2 remains robustly expressed but changes its subcellular localization from >20 small cytoplasmic foci in NSC to one-five large peri-nuclear puncta per neuron. Unexpectedly, we discovered that in human brain organoids, NELL2 is readily detectable in the oligodendroglia and that the number of NELL2 puncta increases as oligodendrocytes mature. Artificial intelligence-based machine learning further predicts a strong association of NELL2 with multiple human white matter diseases, suggesting that NELL2 may possess yet unexplored roles in regulating oligodendrogenesis and/or myelination during human cortical development and maturation.

Improvements in growth-related traits reduce fish time and production costs to reach market size. Feed deprivation and refeeding cycles have been introduced to maximize aquaculture profits through compensatory growth. However, the molecular compensatory growth signature is still uncertain in Nile tilapia. In this study, fish were subjected to two weeks of fasting followed by two weeks of refeeding. The growth curve in refed tilapia was suggestive of a partial compensatory response. Transcriptome profiling of starved and refed fish was conducted to identify genes regulating muscle atrophy and compensatory growth. Pairwise comparisons revealed 5009 and 478 differentially expressed (differential) transcripts during muscle atrophy and recovery, respectively. Muscle atrophy appears to be mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy/lysosome systems. Autophagy-related 2A, F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7, F-box only protein 32, miR-137, and miR-153 showed exceptional high expression suggesting them as master regulators of muscle atrophy. On the other hand, the muscle compensatory growth response appears to be mediated by the continuous stimulation of muscle hypertrophy which exceeded normal levels found in control fish. For instance, genes promoting ribosome biogenesis or enhancing the efficiency of translational machinery were upregulated in compensatory muscle growth. Additionally, myogenic microRNAs (e.g., miR-1 and miR-206), and hypertrophy-associated microRNAs (e.g., miR-27a-3p, miR-29c, and miR-29c) were reciprocally expressed to favor hypertrophy during muscle recovery. Overall, the present study provided insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating muscle mass in fish. The study pinpoints extensive growth-related gene networks that could be used to inform breeding programs and also serve as valuable genomic resources for future mechanistic studies.

Why individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2-induced neuropathology remains elusive. Choroid plexus (ChP) plays critical roles in barrier function and immune response modulation and expresses the ACE2 receptor and the chromosome 21-encoded TMPRSS2 protease, suggesting its substantial role in establishing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain. To explore this, we established brain organoids from DS and isogenic euploid iPSC that consist of a core of functional cortical neurons surrounded by a functional ChP-like epithelium (ChPCOs). DS-ChPCOs recapitulated abnormal DS cortical development and revealed defects in ciliogenesis and epithelial cell polarity in ChP-like epithelium. We then demonstrated that the ChP-like epithelium facilitates infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cortical neurons and that this is increased in DS. Inhibiting TMPRSS2 and furin activity reduced viral replication in DS-ChPCOs to euploid levels. This model enables dissection of the role of ChP in neurotropic virus infection and euploid forebrain development and permits screening of therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2-induced neuropathogenesis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38838150/

Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is known to inhibit neurodifferentiation and induce neurodegeneration. Agarwood or Aquilaria crassna (AC), a plant with health-promoting properties, may counteract the neurotoxic effects of B[a]P by promoting neuronal growth and survival. This study investigated the protective effect of AC leaf ethanolic extract (ACEE) on the B[a]P-induced impairment of neuronal differentiation. A transcriptomic analysis identified the canonical pathway, the biological network, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are changed in response to neuronal differentiation and neurogenesis. Several genes, including CXCR4, ENPP2, GAP43, GFRA2, NELL2, NFASC, NSG2, NGB, BASP1, and NEUROD1, in B[a]P-treated SH-SY5Y cells were up-regulated after treatment with ACEE. Notably, a Western blot analysis further confirmed that ACEE increased the protein levels of GAP43 and neuroglobin. B[a]P treatment led to decreased phosphorylation of Akt and increased phosphorylation of ERK in SH-SY5Y cells; however, ACEE was able to reverse these effects. Clionasterol and lupenone were identified in ACEE. Molecular docking showed that these two phytochemicals had significant interactions with CXCR4, GDNF family receptor alpha (GFRA), and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). In conclusion, ACEE may be a potential alternative medicine for the prevention of impaired neuronal differentiation and neurodegenerative diseases.

Syndromic CLN3-Batten is a fatal, pediatric, neurodegenerative disease caused by variants in CLN3, which encodes the endolysosomal transmembrane CLN3 protein. No approved treatment for CLN3 is currently available. The protracted and asynchronous disease presentation complicates the evaluation of potential therapies using clinical disease progression parameters. Biomarkers as surrogates to measure the progression and effect of potential therapeutics are needed. We performed proteomic discovery studies using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 28 CLN3-affected and 32 age-similar non-CLN3 individuals. Proximal extension assay (PEA) of 1467 proteins and untargeted data-dependent mass spectrometry [MS; MassIVE FTP server (ftp://MSV000090147@massive.ucsd.edu)] were used to generate orthogonal lists of protein marker candidates. At an adjusted p-value of <0.1 and threshold CLN3/non-CLN3 fold-change ratio of 1.5, PEA identified 54 and MS identified 233 candidate biomarkers. Some of these (NEFL, CHIT1) have been previously linked with other neurologic conditions. Others (CLPS, FAM217B, QRICH2, KRT16, ZNF333) appear to be novel. Both methods identified 25 candidate biomarkers, including CHIT1, NELL1, and ISLR2 which had absolute fold-change ratios >2. NELL1 and ISLR2 regulate axonal development in neurons and are intriguing new candidates for further investigation in CLN3. In addition to identifying candidate proteins for CLN3 research, this study provides a comparison of two large-scale proteomic discovery methods in CSF.

The common ancestor of all vertebrates had a highly sophisticated nervous system, but questions remain about the evolution of vertebrate neural cell types. The amphioxus, a chordate that diverged before the origin of vertebrates, can inform vertebrate evolution. Here we develop and analyse a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset from seven amphioxus embryo stages to understand chordate cell type evolution and to study vertebrate neural cell type origins. We identified many new amphioxus cell types, including homologues to the vertebrate hypothalamus and neurohypophysis, rooting the evolutionary origin of these structures. On the basis of ancestor-descendant reconstruction of cell trajectories of the amphioxus and other species, we inferred expression dynamics of transcription factor genes throughout embryogenesis and identified three ancient developmental routes forming chordate neurons. We characterized cell specification at the mechanistic level and generated mutant lines to examine the function of five key transcription factors involved in neural specification. Our results show three developmental origins for the vertebrate nervous system: an anterior FoxQ2-dependent mechanism that is deeply conserved in invertebrates, a less-conserved route leading to more posterior neurons in the vertebrate spinal cord and a mechanism for specifying neuromesoderm progenitors that is restricted to chordates. The evolution of neuromesoderm progenitors may have led to a dramatic shift in posterior neural and mesodermal cell fate decisions and the body elongation process in a stem chordate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39025981/

The human brain stands as an intricate organ, embodying a nexus of structure, function, development, and diversity. This review delves into the multifaceted landscape of the brain, spanning its anatomical intricacies, diverse functional capacities, dynamic developmental trajectories, and inherent variability across individuals. The dynamic process of brain development, from early embryonic stages to adulthood, highlights the nuanced changes that occur throughout the lifespan. The brain, a remarkably complex organ, is composed of various anatomical regions, each contributing uniquely to its overall functionality. Through an exploration of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and electrophysiology, this review elucidates how different brain structures interact to support a wide array of cognitive processes, sensory perception, motor control, and emotional regulation. Moreover, it addresses the impact of age, sex, and ethnic background on brain structure and function, and gender differences profoundly influence the onset, progression, and manifestation of brain disorders shaped by genetic, hormonal, environmental, and social factors. Delving into the complexities of the human brain, it investigates how variations in anatomical configuration correspond to diverse functional capacities across individuals. Furthermore, it examines the impact of neurodegenerative diseases on the structural and functional integrity of the brain. Specifically, our article explores the pathological processes underlying neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, shedding light on the structural alterations and functional impairments that accompany these conditions. We will also explore the current research trends in neurodegenerative diseases and identify the existing gaps in the literature. Overall, this article deepens our understanding of the fundamental principles governing brain structure and function and paves the way for a deeper understanding of individual differences and tailored approaches in neuroscience and clinical practice-additionally, a comprehensive understanding of structural and functional changes that manifest in neurodegenerative diseases.

Brain information processing complexity is conventionally recognized as derived from neuronal activity, with neurons and their dynamic signalling responsible for the transfer and processing of information. However, the brain also contains other non-neuronal cells, glial cells, which exceed the number of neurons and are involved in the processes related with information coding by neural networks and underlying brain functions. Decisive advances in the characterization of the molecular and physiological properties of glial cells shed light on their active roles in neurotransmission and neuronal physiopathology. This expanded relationship between neurons and glia challenges traditional neurobiology by highlighting their reciprocal influence, where it is difficult to determine whether neuronal or glial processes initiate and drive the interactions. This interplay creates a dilemma, where the causal hierarchy between these two cell types remains unresolved. A philosophical tool, the 'Theory of Complexity' of Edgard Morin can help to better explain and study the complexity of neuron-glia interactions. Morin's proposal on complexity is useful to transform brain knowledge, in order to review the brain molecular functions in antireductionist pattern. In this manuscript, we will discuss how to use the 'retroactive loop' principle from Morin's 'Theory of Complexity' at the brain molecular level, proposing a new philosophical-experimental grid that can help neuroscientists for a better understanding of the glia-neuron interactions in the brain.

Neuronal architecture established embryonically must persist lifelong to ensure normal brain function. However, little is understood about the mechanisms behind the long-term maintenance of neuronal organization. To uncover maintenance mechanisms, we performed a suppressor screen in sax-7/L1CAM mutants, which exhibit progressive disorganization with age. We identified the conserved extracellular matrix protein MIG-6/papilin as a key regulator of neuronal maintenance. Combining incisive molecular genetics, structural predictions, in vivo quantitative imaging, and cutting-edge Brillouin microscopy, we show that MIG-6/papilin remodels extracellular matrix collagen IV, working in concert with the secreted enzymes MIG-17/ADAMTS and PXN-2/peroxidasin. This remodeling impacts tissue biomechanics and ensures neuronal stability, even under increased mechanical stress. Our findings highlight an extracellular mechanism by which MIG-6/papilin supports the integrity of neuronal architecture throughout life. This work provides critical insights into the molecular basis of sustaining neuronal architecture and offers a foundation for understanding age-related and neurodegenerative disorders.

Organoids are three-dimensional, miniaturized tissue-like structures derived from either stem cells or primary cells, emerging as powerful in vitro models for studying developmental biology, disease pathology, and drug discovery. These organoids more accurately mimic cell-cell interactions and complexities of human tissues compared to traditional cell cultures. However, challenges such as limited nutrient supply and biomechanical cue replication hinder their maturation and viability. Microfluidic technologies, with their ability to control fluid flow and mimic the mechanical environment of tissues, have been integrated with organoids to create organoid-on-chip models that address these limitations. These models not only improve the physiological relevance of organoids but also enable more precise investigation of disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. By combining microfluidics and organoids, several advanced organoids-on-chip models have been developed to investigate mechanical and biochemical cues involved in disease progression. This review discusses various methods to develop organoids-on-chip and the recently established organoids-on-chip models with their advanced functions.

Neurodegenerative disorder refers to malfunctioning of neurons their degradation leading to death of neurons. Among various neurodegenerative disorders APHD (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's Disease) are particularly concerning due to their progressive and debilitating nature. The therapeutic agent used for treatment and management of APHD often show unsatisfactory clinical outcome owing to poor solubility and limited permeability across blood brain barrier (BBB). The nose-to brain delivery can overcome this BBB challenge as it can transport drug directly to brain though olfactory pathways bypassing BBB. Additionally, the nanotechnology has emerged as a cutting-edge methodology to address this issue and specifically mucoadhesive micro/nanoemulsion can improve the overall performance of the drug when administered intranasally. Beyond the therapy neurotechnology has emerged as are revolutionary AI-driven BCI (Brain computer interface) aimed to restore independence in patients with function loss due to neuron degeneration/death. A promising BCI Neuralink has been recently explored for clinical trials and results revealed that a quadriplegia bearing person with implanted Neuralink chip was able to perform few normal functions of daily routine such as playing online games, text messaging, reading, and learning foreign languages online through accessing the particular websites. This review will discuss the fundamental concepts of neurodegeneration, application of micro/nanoemulsion through intranasal route and integration of neurotechnology for the management and treatment of APHD.

100,New developments in the biology of fibroblast growth factors,"David M Ornitz  1 , ; Nobuyuki Itoh  2; ; ; ","Abstract
The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family is composed of 18 secreted signaling proteins consisting of canonical FGFs and endocrine FGFs that activate four receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFRs 1-4) and four intracellular proteins (intracellular FGFs or iFGFs) that primarily function to regulate the activity of voltage-gated sodium channels and other molecules. The canonical FGFs, endocrine FGFs, and iFGFs have been reviewed extensively by us and others. In this review, we briefly summarize past reviews and then focus on new developments in the FGF field since our last review in 2015. Some of the highlights in the past 6 years include the use of optogenetic tools, viral vectors, and inducible transgenes to experimentally modulate FGF signaling, the clinical use of small molecule FGFR inhibitors, an expanded understanding of endocrine FGF signaling, functions for FGF signaling in stem cell pluripotency and differentiation, roles for FGF signaling in tissue homeostasis and regeneration, a continuing elaboration of mechanisms of FGF signaling in development, and an expanding appreciation of roles for FGF signaling in neuropsychiatric diseases.

102,Diverse Fgfr1 signaling pathways and endocytic trafficking regulate mesoderm development,"James F Clark  1 , ; Philippe Soriano  2; ; ; ","Abstract
The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway is a conserved signaling pathway required for embryonic development. Activated FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) drives multiple intracellular signaling cascade pathways, including ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT, collectively termed canonical signaling. However, unlike Fgfr1-null embryos, embryos containing hypomorphic mutations in Fgfr1 lacking the ability to activate canonical downstream signals are still able to develop to birth but exhibit severe defects in all mesodermal-derived tissues. The introduction of an additional signaling mutation further reduces the activity of Fgfr1, leading to earlier lethality, reduced somitogenesis, and more severe changes in transcriptional outputs. Genes involved in migration, ECM interaction, and phosphoinositol signaling were significantly downregulated, proteomic analysis identified changes in interactions with endocytic pathway components, and cells expressing mutant receptors show changes in endocytic trafficking. Together, we identified processes regulating early mesoderm development by mechanisms involving both canonical and noncanonical Fgfr1 pathways, including direct interaction with cell adhesion components and endocytic regulation.

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling elicits multiple downstream pathways, most notably the Ras/MAPK cascade facilitated by the adaptor protein Grb2. However, the mechanism by which Grb2 is recruited to the FGF signaling complex remains unresolved. Here we showed that genetic ablation of FGF signaling prevented lens induction by disrupting transcriptional regulation and actin cytoskeletal arrangements, which could be reproduced by deleting the juxtamembrane region of the FGF receptor and rescued by Kras activation. Conversely, mutations affecting the Frs2-binding site on the FGF receptor or the deletion of Frs2 and Shp2 primarily impact later stages of lens vesicle development involving lens fiber cell differentiation. Our study further revealed that the loss of Grb2 abolished MAPK signaling, resulting in a profound arrest of lens development. However, removing Grb2's putative Shp2 dephosphorylation site (Y209) neither produced a detectable phenotype nor impaired MAPK signaling during lens development. Furthermore, the catalytically inactive Shp2 mutation (C459S) only modestly impaired FGF signaling, whereas replacing Shp2's C-terminal phosphorylation sites (Y542/Y580) previously implicated in Grb2 binding only caused placental defects, perinatal lethality, and reduced lacrimal gland branching without impacting lens development, suggesting that Shp2 only partially mediates Grb2 recruitment. In contrast, we observed that FGF signaling is required for the phosphorylation of the Grb2-binding sites on Shc1 and the deletion of Shc1 exacerbates the lens vesicle defect caused by Frs2 and Shp2 deletion. These findings establish Shc1 as a critical collaborator with Frs2 and Shp2 in targeting Grb2 during FGF signaling.

Epithelial cancers disrupt tissue architecture and are often driven by mutations in genes that normally play important roles in epithelial morphogenesis. The intrahepatic biliary system is an epithelial tubular network that forms within the developing liver via the de novo initiation and expansion of apical lumens. Intrahepatic biliary tumors are often driven by different types of mutations in the FGFR2 receptor tyrosine kinase which plays important roles in epithelial morphogenesis in other developmental settings. Using a physiologic and quantitative 3D model we have found that FGFR signaling is important for biliary morphogenesis and that oncogenic FGFR2 mutants disrupt biliary architecture. Importantly, we found that both the trafficking and signaling of normal FGFR2 and the phenotypic consequences of FGFR2 mutants are influenced by the epithelial state of the cell. Unexpectedly, we found that different tumor-driving FGFR2 mutants disrupt biliary morphogenesis in completely different and clinically relevant ways, informing our understanding of morphogenesis and tumorigenesis and highlighting the importance of convergent studies of both.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39282270/

SHP2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) crucial in Ras-MAPK signaling, is associated with various human congenital diseases and cancers. Here, we show that the catalytically inactive Shp2 C459S mutation results in communicating hydrocephalus, similar to the catalytically activating Shp2 E76K and Mek1 DD mutants. Unlike previous mutants, however, Shp2 C459S/+ mutation uniquely affects ciliary development rather than neurogenesis, leading to reduced cilia density and impaired ciliary motility. Differential scanning fluorimetry revealed that SHP2 C459S , SHP2 E76K and SHP2 C459S/E76K mutations all induce an open SHP2 conformation, but only SHP2 C459S leads to aberrant GAB1 phosphorylation in cells expressing wild-type SHP2. This distinctive signaling pattern correlates with our observations in brain ventricular tissues of Shp2 C459S/+ mice, where Erk and Stat3 activities remain normal but Gab1 phosphorylation is elevated. Critically, we show that the hydrocephalus phenotype in Shp2 C459S mice can be mitigated by allosteric inhibition of Shp2. These findings suggest that Shp2-associated hydrocephalus is driven by conformational changes rather than altered catalytic activity. Our results underscore the therapeutic potential of conformation-specific allosteric inhibitors in targeting both catalytically active and inactive SHP2 mutants.

Background: Congenital anomalies and neurodevelopmental disorders are complex conditions often requiring comprehensive diagnostic approaches. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), particularly whole-exome sequencing (WES), has greatly improved the detection of pathogenic variants, including copy number variations (CNVs), which account for up to 35% of genetic causes in neurological patients. Combining CNV and single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis through WES enhances diagnostic accuracy, especially in cases with unclassified congenital anomalies.
Case presentation and literature review: This study reports a 14-year-old male patient with multiple congenital anomalies, including hypospadias, complete cleft palate, and recurrent pneumonia. His clinical presentation includes significant physical and intellectual developmental delays, autism-like symptoms, and spastic diplegia. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed due to these complex symptoms, revealing a novel heterozygous deletion on chromosome 10q24.31-q24.33. Laboratory findings indicated agammaglobulinemia, leading to prophylactic antibiotic therapy and immunoglobulin replacement. Additional imaging studies showed cystic malformation of the middle lobe of the right lung, sliding hiatal hernia with prolapse of the gastric mucosa, and brain anomalies consistent with Joubert syndrome.
Conclusions: This case underscores the importance of genetic analysis in understanding the etiology of congenital anomalies and neurodevelopmental disorders, providing critical insights into the molecular mechanisms driving complex phenotypes. The identified chromosomal deletion contributes to the existing literature on genomic imbalances associated with similar phenotypes.

The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family comprises 15 paracrine-acting and 3 endocrine-acting polypeptides, which govern a multitude of processes in human development, metabolism and tissue homeostasis. Therapeutic endocrine FGFs have recently advanced in clinical trials, with FGF19 and FGF21-based therapies on the cusp of approval for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis and metabolic syndrome-associated steatohepatitis, respectively. By contrast, while paracrine FGFs were once thought to be promising drug candidates for wound healing, burns, tissue repair and ischaemic ailments based on their potent mitogenic and angiogenic properties, repeated failures in clinical trials have led to the widespread perception that the development of paracrine FGF-based drugs is not feasible. However, the observation that paracrine FGFs can exert FGF hormone-like metabolic activities has restored interest in these FGFs. The recent structural elucidation of the FGF cell surface signalling machinery and the formulation of a new threshold model for FGF signalling specificity have paved the way for therapeutically harnessing paracrine FGFs for the treatment of a range of metabolic diseases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39875570/

Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 infection initiates upon viral entry into the basal cells of the epithelium. The virus manipulates signaling pathways to complete its life cycle, which depends on cellular differentiation. The virus expresses the oncoproteins E5, E6, and E7 to promote immune evasion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis inhibition, and viral replication. The least studied viral oncoprotein is E5 (16E5), which can regulate epithelial growth factor receptor (GFR) signaling pathways. GFRs such as transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR) have essential roles in cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. These receptors obtain their ligands from the microenvironment, and once activated, regulate cellular behavior in the epithelium. GFRs therefore represent valuable targets for the virus to establish and maintain a cellular environment supportive of infection. The ability of 16E5 to regulate proliferation and differentiation varies through the differentiating epithelium, making it necessary to adequately describe the association between 16E5 and GFRs. Here we summarize the regulation of GFR signaling pathways by 16E5, discuss the roles of stromal growth factors, and outline unresolved questions over cellular differentiation and proliferation during the HPV life cycle.

Background: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a secreted protein, plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism and energy homeostasis. Nevertheless, the expression pattern of Fgf21 across diverse tissues and its responsiveness to various dietary regimens remain incompletely understood. Methods: In this study, we developed a Fgf21-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter mouse model to explore the expression of endogenous Fgf21 in different tissues under four dietary conditions: normal chow, low-protein diet, fasting, and fasting-refeeding. Results: A low-protein diet was found to induce Fgf21 expression in both the liver and skeletal muscle. Notably, Fgf21 was predominantly expressed in the periportal region of the liver. In the pancreas, Fgf21 exhibited a patchy expression pattern in the exocrine portion, but was absent in the endocrine part, regardless of the dietary regimens. Regarding the spleen, fasting triggered the expression of Fgf21, which was mainly localized in the red pulp area. Moreover, under fasting conditions, Fgf21 showed a scattered expression pattern in the small intestine. Conclusions: The Fgf21-EGFP reporter mouse model serves as a valuable tool for dissecting the expression of endogenous Fgf21 in different tissues under various dietary and stress conditions. Further investigations using this model may contribute to uncovering the hitherto unrecognized functions of locally produced FGF21.

111,FGF signaling regulates salivary gland branching morphogenesis by modulating cell adhesion,"Ayan T Ray  1 , ; Philippe Soriano  1; ; ; ","Abstract
Loss of FGF signaling leads to defects in salivary gland branching, but the mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain largely unknown. We disrupted expression of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 in salivary gland epithelial cells and found that both receptors function coordinately in regulating branching. Strikingly, branching morphogenesis in double knockouts is restored by Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 (Fgfr1/2) knock-in alleles incapable of engaging canonical RTK signaling, suggesting that additional FGF-dependent mechanisms play a role in salivary gland branching. Fgfr1/2 conditional null mutants showed defective cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, both of which have been shown to play instructive roles in salivary gland branching. Loss of FGF signaling led to disordered cell-basement membrane interactions in vivo as well as in organ culture. This was partially restored upon introducing Fgfr1/2 wild-type or signaling alleles that are incapable of eliciting canonical intracellular signaling. Together, our results identify non-canonical FGF signaling mechanisms that regulate branching morphogenesis through cell-adhesion processes.

Multipotent epithelial progenitor cells can be expanded from human embryonic lungs as organoids and maintained in a self-renewing state using a defined medium. The organoid cells are columnar, resembling the cell morphology of the developing lung tip epithelium in vivo. Cell shape dynamics and fate are tightly coordinated during development. We therefore used the organoid system to identify signalling pathways that maintain the columnar shape of human lung tip progenitors. We found that EGF, FGF7 and FGF10 have distinct functions in lung tip progenitors. FGF7 activates MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signalling, and is sufficient to promote columnar cell shape in primary tip progenitors. Inhibitor experiments show that MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signalling are key downstream pathways, regulating cell proliferation, columnar cell shape and cell junctions. We identified integrin signalling as a key pathway downstream of MAPK/ERK in the tip progenitors; disrupting integrin alters polarity, cell adhesion and tight junction assembly. By contrast, stimulation with FGF10 or EGF alone is not sufficient to maintain organoid columnar cell shape. This study employs organoids to provide insight into the cellular mechanisms regulating human lung development.

Alveolar type 2 (AT2) epithelial cells are tissue stem cells capable of differentiating into alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells for injury repair and maintenance of lung homeostasis. However, the factors involved in human AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation are not fully understood. Here, we established SFTPCGFP and AGERmCherry-HiBiT dual-reporter induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which detected AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation with high sensitivity and identified factors inducing AT1 cell differentiation from AT2 and their progenitor cells. We also established an ""on-gel"" alveolar epithelial spheroid culture suitable for medium-throughput screening. Among the 274 chemical compounds, several single compounds, including LATS-IN-1, converted AT1 cells from AT2 and their progenitor cells. Moreover, YAP/TAZ signaling activation and AKT signaling suppression synergistically recapitulated the induction of transcriptomic, morphological, and functionally mature AT1 cells. Our findings provide novel insights into human lung development and lung regenerative medicine.

Although lentiviral vectors (LVVs) are highly effective for stable expression due to their integrative properties, achieving efficient transduction in human iPSC-derived lung organoids poses a significant technical challenge, likely due to the complex structure of these organoids. In this study, we optimized a method to enhance LVV transduction efficiency by physically disrupting the organoids to increase surface area, followed by spinoculation to apply shear force during cell dissociation. This approach, combined with the use of an optimized culture medium, significantly improved transduction efficiency. The success of this method was validated at both the gene and protein levels using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and various cellular and molecular assays. Our optimized transduction protocol may provide a valuable tool for investigating specific cellular and molecular mechanisms in development and disease models using human iPSCs-derived lung organoids.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39900972/
119,FRS2-independent GRB2 interaction with FGFR2 is not required for embryonic development,"James F Clark  1 , ; Philippe Soriano  1; ; ; ","Abstract
FGF activation is known to engage canonical signals, including ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT, through various effectors including FRS2 and GRB2. Fgfr2 FCPG/FCPG mutants that abrogate canonical intracellular signaling exhibit a range of mild phenotypes but are viable in contrast to embryonic lethal Fgfr2 -/- mutants. GRB2 has been reported to interact with FGFR2 through a non-traditional mechanism, by binding to the C-terminus of FGFR2 independently of FRS2 recruitment. To investigate if this interaction provides functionality beyond canonical signaling, we generated mutant mice harboring a C-terminal truncation (T). We found that Fgfr2 T/T mice are viable and have no distinguishable phenotype, indicating that GRB2 binding to the C-terminal end of FGFR2 is not required for development or adult homeostasis. We further introduced the T mutation on the sensitized FCPG background but found that Fgfr2 FCPGT/FCPGT mutants did not exhibit significantly more severe phenotypes. We therefore conclude that, while GRB2 can bind to FGFR2 independently of FRS2, this binding does not have a critical role in development or homeostasis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36993499/
120,ΔNp63 regulates Sfrp1 expression to direct salivary gland branching morphogenesis,"Theresa Wrynn  1 , ; Sangwon Min  2 , ; Erich Horeth  1 , ; Jason Osinski  1 , ; Satrajit Sinha  3 , ; Rose-Anne Romano  1   3; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","Abstract
Branching morphogenesis is a complex process shared by many organs including the lungs, kidney, prostate, as well as several exocrine organs including the salivary, mammary and lacrimal glands. This critical developmental program ensures the expansion of an organ's surface area thereby maximizing processes of cellular secretion or absorption. It is guided by reciprocal signaling from the epithelial and mesenchymal cells. While signaling pathways driving salivary gland branching morphogenesis have been relatively well-studied, our understanding of the underlying transcriptional regulatory mechanisms directing this program, is limited. Here, we performed in vivo and ex vivo studies of the embryonic mouse submandibular gland to determine the function of the transcription factor ΔNp63, in directing branching morphogenesis. Our studies show that loss of ΔNp63 results in alterations in the differentiation program of the ductal cells which is accompanied by a dramatic reduction in branching morphogenesis that is mediated by dysregulation of WNT signaling. We show that ΔNp63 modulates WNT signaling to promote branching morphogenesis by directly regulating Sfrp1 expression. Collectively, our findings have revealed a novel role for ΔNp63 in the regulation of this critical process and offers a better understanding of the transcriptional networks involved in branching morphogenesis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38722977/

Whole salivary gland generation and transplantation offer potential therapies for salivary gland dysfunction. However, the specific lineage required to engineer complete salivary glands has remained elusive. In this study, we identify the Foxa2 lineage as a critical lineage for salivary gland development through conditional blastocyst complementation (CBC). Foxa2 lineage marking begins at the boundary between the endodermal and ectodermal regions of the oral epithelium before the formation of the primordial salivary gland, thereby labeling the entire gland. Ablation of Fgfr2 within the Foxa2 lineage in mice leads to salivary gland agenesis. We reversed this phenotype by injecting donor pluripotent stem cells into the mouse blastocysts, resulting in mice that survived to adulthood with salivary glands of normal size, comparable to those of their littermate controls. These findings demonstrate that CBC-based salivary gland regeneration serves as a foundational experimental approach for future advanced cell-based therapies.

122,Chimeric Livers: Interspecies Blastocyst Complementation and Xenotransplantation for End-Stage Liver Disease,"Madelyn J Blake  1 , ; Clifford J Steer  2; ; ; ","Abstract
Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) currently serves as the sole definitive treatment for thousands of patients suffering from end-stage liver disease; and the existing supply of donor livers for OLT is drastically outpaced by the increasing demand. To alleviate this significant gap in treatment, several experimental approaches have been devised with the aim of either offering interim support to patients waiting on the transplant list or bioengineering complete livers for OLT by infusing them with fresh hepatic cells. Recently, interspecies blastocyst complementation has emerged as a promising method for generating complete organs in utero over a short timeframe. When coupled with gene editing technology, it has brought about a potentially revolutionary transformation in regenerative medicine. Blastocyst complementation harbors notable potential for generating complete human livers in large animals, which could be used for xenotransplantation in humans, addressing the scarcity of livers for OLT. Nevertheless, substantial experimental and ethical challenges still need to be overcome to produce human livers in larger domestic animals like pigs. This review compiles the current understanding of interspecies blastocyst complementation and outlines future possibilities for liver xenotransplantation in humans.

123,Xenopus leads the way: Frogs as a pioneering model to understand the human brain,"Cameron R T Exner  1 , ; Helen Rankin Willsey  1; ; ; ","Abstract
From its long history in the field of embryology to its recent advances in genetics, Xenopus has been an indispensable model for understanding the human brain. Foundational studies that gave us our first insights into major embryonic patterning events serve as a crucial backdrop for newer avenues of investigation into organogenesis and organ function. The vast array of tools available in Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis allows interrogation of developmental phenomena at all levels, from the molecular to the behavioral, and the application of CRISPR technology has enabled the investigation of human disorder risk genes in a higher-throughput manner. As the only major tetrapod model in which all developmental stages are easily manipulated and observed, frogs provide the unique opportunity to study organ development from the earliest stages. All of these features make Xenopus a premier model for studying the development of the brain, a notoriously complex process that demands an understanding of all stages from fertilization to organogenesis and beyond. Importantly, core processes of brain development are conserved between Xenopus and human, underlining the advantages of this model. This review begins by summarizing discoveries made in amphibians that form the cornerstones of vertebrate neurodevelopmental biology and goes on to discuss recent advances that have catapulted our understanding of brain development in Xenopus and in relation to human development and disease. As we engage in a new era of patient-driven gene discovery, Xenopus offers exceptional potential to uncover conserved biology underlying human brain disorders and move towards rational drug design.

The co-occurrence of autism and gastrointestinal distress is well-established, yet the molecular underpinnings remain unknown. The identification of high-confidence, large-effect autism genes offers the opportunity to identify convergent, underlying biology by studying these genes in the context of the gastrointestinal system. Here we show that the expression of these genes is enriched in human prenatal gut neurons and their migratory progenitors, suggesting that the development and/or function of these neurons may be disrupted by autism-associated genetic variants, leading to gastrointestinal dysfunction. Here we document the prevalence of gastrointestinal issues in patients with large-effect variants in sixteen autism genes, highlighting dysmotility, consistent with potential enteric neuron dysfunction. Using Xenopus tropicalis, we individually target five of these genes (SYNGAP1, CHD8, SCN2A, CHD2, and DYRK1A) and observe disrupted enteric neuronal progenitor migration for each. Further analysis of DYRK1A reveals that perturbation causes gut dysmotility in vivo, which can be ameliorated by treatment with either of two serotonin signaling modulators, identified by in vivo drug screening. This work suggests that atypical development of enteric neurons contributes to the gastrointestinal distress commonly seen in individuals with autism and that serotonin signaling may be a productive therapeutic pathway.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40050271/

Comprehensive understanding of interconnected networks within the brain requires access to high resolution information within large field of views and over time. Currently, methods that enable mapping structural changes of the entire brain in vivo are extremely limited. Third harmonic generation (THG) can resolve myelinated structures, blood vessels, and cell bodies throughout the brain without the need for any exogenous labeling. Together with deep penetration of long wavelengths, this enables in vivo brain-mapping of large fractions of the brain in small animals and over time. Here, we demonstrate that THG microscopy allows non-invasive label-free mapping of the entire brain of an adult vertebrate, Danionella dracula, which is a miniature species of cyprinid fish. We show this capability in multiple brain regions and in particular the identification of major commissural fiber bundles in the midbrain and the hindbrain. These features provide readily discernable landmarks for navigation and identification of regional-specific neuronal groups and even single neurons during in vivo experiments. We further show how this label-free technique can easily be coupled with fluorescence microscopy and used as a comparative tool for studies of other species with similar body features to Danionella, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) and tetras (Trochilocharax ornatus). This new evidence, building on previous studies, demonstrates how small size and relative transparency, combined with the unique capabilities of THG microscopy, can enable label-free access to the entire adult vertebrate brain.

Animals integrate information from different sensory modalities as they mature and perform increasingly complex behaviors. This may parallel differential investment in specific brain regions depending on the changing demands of sensory inputs. To investigate developmental changes in the volume of canonical sensory regions, we used third harmonic generation imaging for morphometric analysis of forebrain and midbrain regions from larval through juvenile and adult stages in Danionella dracula, a transparent, miniature teleost fish whose brain is optically accessible throughout its lifespan. Relative to whole-brain volume, increased volume or investment in the telencephalon, a higher order sensory integration center, shows the most dramatic increases between 30-60 days postfertilization (dpf) and again at 90 dpf as animals reach adulthood. The torus longitudinalis (TL), a midbrain visuomotor integration center, also significantly increases between 60 and 90 dpf. In contrast, investment in the midbrain optic tectum (TeO), a retinal-recipient target, progressively decreases from 30 to 90 dpf, whereas investment is relatively consistent across all stages for the midbrain torus semicircularis (TS), a secondary auditory and mechanosensory lateral line center, and the olfactory bulb (OB), a direct target of the olfactory epithelium. In sum, increased investment in higher-order integration centers (telencephalon, TL) occurs as juveniles reach adulthood (60-90 dpf) and exhibit more complex cognitive tasks, whereas investment in modality-dominant regions occurs earlier (TeO) or is relatively consistent across development (TS, OB). Complete optical access throughout Danionella's lifespan provides a unique opportunity to investigate how changing brain structure over development correlates with changes in connectivity, microcircuitry, or behavior.

Up to 50% of patients with severe congenital heart disease (CHD) develop life-altering neurodevelopmental disability (NDD). It has been presumed that NDD arises in CHD cases because of hypoxia before, during, or after cardiac surgery. Recent studies detected an enrichment in de novo mutations in CHD and NDD, as well as significant overlap between CHD and NDD candidate genes. However, there is limited evidence demonstrating that genes causing CHD can produce NDD independent of hypoxia. A patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and gross motor delay presented with a de novo mutation in SMC5. Modeling mutation of smc5 in Xenopus tropicalis embryos resulted in reduced heart size, decreased brain length, and disrupted pax6 patterning. To evaluate the cardiac development, we induced the conditional knockout (cKO) of Smc5 in mouse cardiomyocytes, which led to the depletion of mature cardiomyocytes and abnormal contractility. To test a role for Smc5 specifically in the brain, we induced cKO in the mouse central nervous system, which resulted in decreased brain volume, and diminished connectivity between areas related to motor function but did not affect vascular or brain ventricular volume. We propose that genetic factors, rather than hypoxia alone, can contribute when NDD and CHD cases occur concurrently.

129,Regulation of p53 by the mitotic surveillance/stopwatch pathway: implications in neurodevelopment and cancer,Travis H Stracker  1; ; ,"Abstract
The transcription factor p53 (encoded by TP53) plays diverse roles in human development and disease. While best known for its role in tumor suppression, p53 signaling also influences mammalian development by triggering cell fate decisions in response to a wide variety of stresses. After over 4 decades of study, a new pathway that triggers p53 activation in response to mitotic delays was recently identified. Termed the mitotic surveillance or mitotic stopwatch pathway, the USP28 and 53BP1 proteins activate p53 in response to delayed mitotic progression to control cell fate and promote genomic stability. In this Minireview, I discuss its identification, potential roles in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, as well as explore outstanding questions about its function, regulation and potential use as a biomarker for anti-mitotic therapies.

More than a hundred genes have been identified that, when disrupted, impart large risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Current knowledge about the encoded proteins - although incomplete - points to a very wide range of developmentally dynamic and diverse biological processes. Moreover, the core symptoms of ASD involve distinctly human characteristics, presenting challenges to interpreting evolutionarily distant model systems. Indeed, despite a decade of striking progress in gene discovery, an actionable understanding of pathobiology remains elusive. Increasingly, convergent neuroscience approaches have been recognized as an important complement to traditional uses of genetics to illuminate the biology of human disorders. These methods seek to identify intersection among molecular-level, cellular-level and circuit-level functions across multiple risk genes and have highlighted developing excitatory neurons in the human mid-gestational prefrontal cortex as an important pathobiological nexus in ASD. In addition, neurogenesis, chromatin modification and synaptic function have emerged as key potential mediators of genetic vulnerability. The continued expansion of foundational 'omics' data sets, the application of higher-throughput model systems and incorporating developmental trajectories and sex differences into future analyses will refine and extend these results. Ultimately, a systems-level understanding of ASD genetic risk holds promise for clarifying pathobiology and advancing therapeutics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35440779/

Background: Deleterious mutations in hundreds of genes confer high risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), posing significant challenges for therapeutic development. Identifying convergent pathways shared across NDD genes could reveal high-impact therapeutic targets.
Methods: To identity convergent pathways in NDD genes, we optimized Perturb-seq, a method combining CRISPR perturbation with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and applied structural topic modeling (STM) to simultaneously assess impact on cell fate and developmental stage. We then studied a subset of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) genes implicated in regulation of gene expression using these improved molecular and analytical approaches.
Results: Results from targeting 60 high-confidence ASD risk genes revealed significant effects on neural development. As expected, ASD risk genes impacted both progenitor fate and/or neuronal differentiation. Using STM, we could identify latent topics jointly capturing cell types, cell fate, and differentiation stages. Repression of ASD risk genes led to changes in topic proportions and effects of four genes (DEAF1, KMT2A, MED13L, and MYT1L) were validated in an independent dataset.
Conclusions: Our optimized Perturb-seq method, combined with a novel analytical approach, provides a powerful, cost-effective framework for uncovering convergent mechanisms among genes involved in complex neurodevelopmental processes. Application of these methods advanced understanding of the impact of ASD mutations on multiple dimensions of neural development, and provides a framework for a broader examination of the function of NDD risk genes.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have ushered in a new era of reproducible discovery in psychiatric genetics. The field has now identified hundreds of common genetic variants that are associated with mental disorders, and many of them influence more than one disorder. By advancing the understanding of causal biology underlying psychopathology, GWAS results are poised to inform the development of novel therapeutics, stratification of at-risk patients, and perhaps even the revision of top-down classification systems in psychiatry. Here, we provide a concise review of GWAS findings with an emphasis on findings that have elucidated the shared genetic etiology of psychopathology, summarizing insights at three levels of analysis: 1) genome-wide architecture; 2) networks, pathways, and gene sets; and 3) individual variants/genes. Three themes emerge from these efforts. First, all psychiatric phenotypes are heritable, highly polygenic, and influenced by many pleiotropic variants with incomplete penetrance. Second, GWAS results highlight the broad etiological roles of neuronal biology, system-wide effects over localized effects, and early neurodevelopment as a critical period. Third, many loci that are robustly associated with multiple forms of psychopathology harbor genes that are involved in synaptic structure and function. Finally, we conclude our review by discussing the implications that GWAS results hold for the field of psychiatry, as well as expected challenges and future directions in the next stage of psychiatric genetics.

Background: The Populations Underrepresented in Mental illness Association Studies (PUMAS) project is attempting to remediate the historical underrepresentation of African and Latin American populations in psychiatric genetics through large-scale genetic association studies of individuals diagnosed with a serious mental illness [SMI, including schizophrenia (SCZ), schizoaffective disorder (SZA) bipolar disorder (BP), and severe major depressive disorder (MDD)] and matched controls. Given growing evidence indicating substantial symptomatic and genetic overlap between these diagnoses, we sought to enable transdiagnostic genetic analyses of PUMAS data by conducting phenotype alignment and harmonization for 89,320 participants (48,165 cases and 41,155 controls) from four cohorts, each of which used different ascertainment and assessment methods: PAISA n=9,105; PUMAS-LATAM n=14,638; NGAP n=42,953 and GPC n=22,624. As we describe here, these efforts have yielded harmonized datasets enabling us to analyze PUMAS genetic variation data at three levels: SMI overall, diagnoses, and individual symptoms.
Methods: In aligning item-level phenotypes obtained from 14 different clinical instruments, we incorporated content, branching nature, and time frame for each phenotype; standardized diagnoses; and selected 19 core SMI item-level phenotypes for analyses. The harmonization was evaluated in PUMAS cases using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), co-occurrence analyses, and item-level endorsement.
Outcomes: We mapped >6,895 item-level phenotypes in the aggregated PUMAS data, in which SCZ (44.97%) and severe BP (BP-I, 31.53%) were the most common diagnoses. Twelve of the 19 core item-level phenotypes occurred at frequencies of > 10% across all diagnoses, indicating their potential utility for transdiagnostic genetic analyses. MCA of the 14 phenotypes that were present for all cohorts revealed consistency across cohorts, and placed MDD and SCZ into separate clusters, while other diagnoses showed no significant phenotypic clustering.
Interpretation: Our alignment strategy effectively aggregated extensive phenotypic data obtained using diverse assessment tools. The MCA yielded dimensional scores which we will use for genetic analyses along with the item level phenotypes. After successful harmonization, residual phenotypic heterogeneity between cohorts reflects differences in branching structure of diagnostic instruments, recruitment strategies, and symptom interpretation (due to cultural variation).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39502669/

Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly cooccurs with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in military populations and is a significant predictor of poor long-term outcomes; however, it is unclear to what extent specific biological variables are associated with comorbidity. This PROSPERO-registered systematic review evaluates the current body of literature on genetic and peripheral biomarkers associated with comorbid TBI and PTSD.
Methods: Searches were conducted in four databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, PTSDPubs, Scopus). We included published studies examining differences in peripheral biomarkers among civilian, military, and veteran participants with both TBI and PTSD compared to those with TBI alone as well as, in some cases, PTSD alone and healthy controls. Data were extracted from included studies and evidence quality was assessed.
Results: Our final analysis included 16 studies, the majority of which were based on data from active duty military and veteran participants. The results suggest that multiple gene variants are likely to contribute to the cumulative risk of PTSD comorbid with TBI. An elevated circulating level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was the most consistently replicated blood-based indicator of comorbid illness, compared to mTBI alone.
Conclusion: Several genetic and protein markers of cellular injury and inflammation appear to be promising indicators of chronic pathology in comorbid TBI and PTSD. Additional research is needed to determine how such factors indicate, predict, and contribute to comorbidity and to what extent they represent viable targets for the development of novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions.

Background: There is considerable comorbidity between externalizing (EXT) and internalizing (INT) psychopathology. Understanding the shared genetic underpinnings of these spectra is crucial for advancing knowledge of their biological bases and informing empirical models like the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) and Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP).
Methods: We applied genomic structural equation modeling to summary statistics from 16 EXT and INT traits in European-ancestry individuals (n = 16,400 to 1,074,629). Traits included clinical (e.g., major depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder) and subclinical measures (e.g., risk tolerance, irritability). We tested five confirmatory factor models to identify the best fitting and most parsimonious genetic architecture and then conducted multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the resulting latent factors.
Results: A two-factor correlated model, representing EXT and INT spectra, provided the best fit to the data. There was a moderate genetic correlation between EXT and INT (r = 0.37, SE = 0.02), with bivariate causal mixture models showing extensive overlap in causal variants across the two spectra (94.64%, SE = 3.27). Multivariate GWAS identified 409 lead genetic variants for EXT, 85 for INT, and 256 for the shared traits.

There is still a lot of ambiguity about the link between physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviors (SBs) and osteoarthritis (OA). This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship of PA/SBs on the risk of OA. A univariate and multivariate Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to investigate the causal effect of five PA phenotypes and three SB phenotypes on overall OA, knee OA, hip OA, total hip arthroplasty, and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). MR methods used were inverse-variance weighting, MR-Egger regressions, and weighted median. Sensitivity analysis examined horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity, and confirmed the reliability of the results. After false discovery rate, light do-it-yourself (DIY) activities decreased the risk for overall OA (OR: 0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.65), and knee OA (OR: 0.26, 95% CI 0.12-0.51). Resulting in a decreased risk of walking for pleasure on overall OA (OR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.70-1.04) and knee OA (OR: 0.14, 95% CI 0.06-0.32) was also observed. Television viewing, however, significantly increased the risk of OA, knee OA, hip OA, and TKA. MVMR findings revealed independent causal impacts of walking for pleasure and watching television on overall and knee OA, taking into account BMI, smoking, and education. This study suggested that light DIY and walking for pleasure were beneficial for preventing OA, and the risk of OA and TKA increased with prolonged television watching.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37938609/
137,"From Serendipity to Precision: Integrating AI, Multi-Omics, and Human-Specific Models for Personalized Neuropsychiatric Care",Masaru Tanaka  1; ; ,"Abstract
Background/Objectives: The dual forces of structured inquiry and serendipitous discovery have long shaped neuropsychiatric research, with groundbreaking treatments such as lithium and ketamine resulting from unexpected discoveries. However, relying on chance is becoming increasingly insufficient to address the rising prevalence of mental health disorders like depression and schizophrenia, which necessitate precise, innovative approaches. Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, induced pluripotent stem cells, and multi-omics have the potential to transform this field by allowing for predictive, patient-specific interventions. Despite these advancements, traditional methodologies such as animal models and single-variable analyses continue to be used, frequently failing to capture the complexities of human neuropsychiatric conditions. Summary: This review critically evaluates the transition from serendipity to precision-based methodologies in neuropsychiatric research. It focuses on key innovations such as dynamic systems modeling and network-based approaches that use genetic, molecular, and environmental data to identify new therapeutic targets. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and human-specific models in overcoming the limitations of traditional approaches. Conclusions: We highlight precision psychiatry's transformative potential for revolutionizing mental health care. This paradigm shift, which combines cutting-edge technologies with systematic frameworks, promises increased diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility, and efficiency, paving the way for tailored treatments and better patient outcomes in neuropsychiatric care.

138,An inhibitory circuit-based enhancer of DYRK1A function reverses Dyrk1a-associated impairment in social recognition,"Yu-Tzu Shih  1 , ; Jason Bondoc Alipio  1 , ; Amar Sahay  2; ; ; ; ","Abstract
Heterozygous mutations in the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1a (Dyrk1a) gene define a syndromic form of autism spectrum disorder. The synaptic and circuit mechanisms mediating DYRK1A functions in social cognition are unclear. Here, we identify a social experience-sensitive mechanism in hippocampal mossy fiber-parvalbumin interneuron (PV IN) synapses by which DYRK1A recruits feedforward inhibition of CA3 and CA2 to promote social recognition. We employ genetic epistasis logic to identify a cytoskeletal protein, ABLIM3, as a synaptic substrate of DYRK1A. We demonstrate that Ablim3 downregulation in dentate granule cells of adult heterozygous Dyrk1a mice is sufficient to restore PV IN-mediated inhibition of CA3 and CA2 and social recognition. Acute chemogenetic activation of PV INs in CA3/CA2 of adult heterozygous Dyrk1a mice also rescued social recognition. Together, these findings illustrate how targeting DYRK1A synaptic and circuit substrates as ""enhancers of DYRK1A function"" harbors the potential to reverse Dyrk1a haploinsufficiency-associated circuit and cognition impairments.

The hippocampus forms memories of our experiences by registering processed sensory information in coactive populations of excitatory principal cells or ensembles1-3. Fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons (PV INs) in the dentate gyrus (DG)-CA3/CA2 circuit contribute to memory encoding by exerting precise temporal control of excitatory principal cell activity through mossy fiber-dependent feed-forward inhibition4-13. PV INs respond to input-specific information by coordinating changes in their intrinsic excitability, input-output synaptic-connectivity, synaptic-physiology and synaptic-plasticity9,13-17, referred to here as experience-dependent PV IN plasticity, to influence hippocampal functions. PV IN impairments in early life, when neural circuitry is highly sensitive to experience-dependent refinement, are thought to result in imbalanced excitation and inhibition, impaired cognition, network hyperexcitability and seizures: hallmarks of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as Autism Spectrum Disorder and epilepsy18-20. Discovery of transcriptional regulators of experience-dependent PV IN plasticity in the adult hippocampus may permit reversal of these developmental impairments. Here, in a screen designed to capture the PV IN intrinsic program induced by increased mossy fiber inputs, a trigger for experience-dependent PV IN plasticity, we identify the homeobox gene Meis2 21 as a regulator of experience-dependent PV IN plasticity gene (XPG) in the adult DG-CA3/CA2 circuit. We found that a significant number of upregulated XPGs also exhibit haploinsufficiency in ASDs, epilepsies, and schizophrenia. We demonstrate that virally-mediated rescue of experience-dependent Meis2 upregulation in CA3/CA2 PV INs in a NDD risk mouse model in adulthood is sufficient to restore experience-dependent PV IN plasticity, spatial and social memory, ensemble specificity, suppression of network hyperexcitability and seizures. Together, these findings suggest that experience-dependent PV IN plasticity is a convergent mechanism for NDD risk genes that can be re-instated in adulthood to reverse developmental deficits in circuitry, network excitability and cognition.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39877097/

The CA3 region is central to hippocampal function during learning and memory and has a unique connectivity. CA3 pyramidal neurons are the targets of huge, excitatory mossy fiber synapses from DG axons and have a high degree of excitatory recurrent connectivity. Thus, inhibition likely plays an outsized importance in constraining excitation and shaping CA3 ensembles during learning and memory. Here, we investigate the function of a never-before studied set of dendrite-targeting, GABAergic neurons defined by expression of the synaptic adhesion molecule, Kirrel3. We discovered that activating Kirrel3-expressing GABAergic neurons specifically impairs memory discrimination and inhibits CA3 pyramidal neurons in novel contexts. Kirrel3 is required for DG-to-GABA synapse formation and variants in Kirrel3 are strong risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, our work suggests that Kirrel3-GABA neurons are a critical source of feed-forward inhibition from DG to CA3 during the encoding and retrieval of contextual memories, a function which may be specifically disrupted in some brain disorders.

Breakdown of lipid homeostasis is thought to contribute to pathological aging, the largest risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cognitive reserve theory posits a role for compensatory mechanisms in the aging brain in preserving neuronal circuit functions, staving off cognitive decline, and mitigating risk for AD. However, the identities of such mechanisms have remained elusive. A screen for hippocampal dentate granule cell (DGC) synapse loss-induced factors identified a secreted phospholipase, Pla2g2f, whose expression increases in DGCs during aging. Pla2g2f deletion in DGCs exacerbates aging-associated pathophysiological changes including synapse loss, inflammatory microglia, reactive astrogliosis, impaired neurogenesis, lipid dysregulation and hippocampal-dependent memory loss. Conversely, boosting Pla2g2f in DGCs during aging is sufficient to preserve synapses, reduce inflammatory microglia and reactive gliosis, prevent hippocampal-dependent memory impairment and modify trajectory of cognitive decline. Ex vivo, neuronal-PLA2G2F mediates intercellular signaling to decrease lipid droplet burden in microglia. Boosting Pla2g2f expression in DGCs of an aging-sensitive AD model reduces amyloid load and improves memory. Our findings implicate PLA2G2F as a compensatory neuroprotective factor that maintains lipid homeostasis to counteract aging-associated cognitive decline.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39211220/

Adaptive regulation of feeding depends on linkage of internal states and food outcomes with contextual cues. Human brain imaging has identified dysregulation of a hippocampal-lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) network in binge eating, but mechanistic instantiation of underlying cell-types and circuitry is lacking. Here, we identify an evolutionary conserved and discrete Prodynorphin (Pdyn)-expressing subpopulation of Somatostatin (Sst)-expressing inhibitory neurons in the dorsolateral septum (DLS) that receives primarily dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampal inputs. DLS(Pdyn) neurons inhibit LHA GABAergic neurons and confer context- and internal state-dependent calibration of feeding. Viral deletion of Pdyn in the DLS mimicked effects seen with optogenetic silencing of DLS Pdyn INs, suggesting a potential role for DYNORPHIN-KAPPA OPIOID RECEPTOR signaling in contextual regulation of food-seeking. Together, our findings illustrate how the dorsal hippocampus has evolved to recruit an ancient LHA feeding circuit module through Pdyn DLS inhibitory neurons to link contextual information with regulation of food consumption.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in sociability and repetitive behaviour, however there is a great heterogeneity within other comorbidities that accompany ASD. Recently, gut microbiome has been pointed out as a plausible contributing factor for ASD development as individuals diagnosed with ASD often suffer from intestinal problems and show a differentiated intestinal microbial composition. Nevertheless, gut microbiome studies in ASD rarely agree on the specific bacterial taxa involved in this disorder. Regarding the potential role of gut microbiome in ASD pathophysiology, our aim is to investigate whether there is a set of bacterial taxa relevant for ASD classification by using a sibling-controlled dataset. Additionally, we aim to validate these results across two independent cohorts as several confounding factors, such as lifestyle, influence both ASD and gut microbiome studies. A machine learning approach, recursive ensemble feature selection (REFS), was applied to 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from 117 subjects (60 ASD cases and 57 siblings) identifying 26 bacterial taxa that discriminate ASD cases from controls. The average area under the curve (AUC) of this specific set of bacteria in the sibling-controlled dataset was 81.6%. Moreover, we applied the selected bacterial taxa in a tenfold cross-validation scheme using two independent cohorts (a total of 223 samples-125 ASD cases and 98 controls). We obtained average AUCs of 74.8% and 74%, respectively. Analysis of the gut microbiome using REFS identified a set of bacterial taxa that can be used to predict the ASD status of children in three distinct cohorts with AUC over 80% for the best-performing classifiers. Our results indicate that the gut microbiome has a strong association with ASD and should not be disregarded as a potential target for therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, our work can contribute to use the proposed approach for identifying microbiome signatures across other 16S rRNA gene sequencing datasets.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38191575/

Autism rates have been reported to be increasing rapidly in industrialized societies. The pathology most often combines neurological symptoms associated with language and social impairments with gastrointestinal symptoms. This study aimed to measure differences in oral metatranscriptome and mitochondrial health between ASD children and neurotypical USA and Colombia (""Blue Zone"") children. In addition, this study aimed to determine whether using prebiotics and probiotics would change the oral microbiome and mitochondrial health of ASD children. Buccal swabs and saliva samples were obtained from 30 autistic individuals (USA) at three intervals: prior to intervention, post-prebiotic, and post-probiotic. In addition, a subject component who were neurotypical, which included individuals from the USA (30) and Colombia (30), had buccal swabbing and salivary sampling performed for metatranscriptomic and mitochondrial comparison. Significant differences were observed in the temporal data, demonstrating shifts that interventions with probiotics and polyols may have precipitated. Particular bacterial strains were significantly more prevalent in the autism group, including a strain that reduced neurotransmitter levels via enzymatic degradation. This supports the hypothesis that the microbiome may influence the occurrence and degree of autism. Verbal skills increased in six of the 30 ASD subjects following xylitol and three more after probiotic supplementation, according to both parental reports and the subjects' healthcare providers.

Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder whose etiology is not known today, but everything indicates that it is multifactorial. For example, genetic and epigenetic factors seem to be involved in the etiology of ASD. In recent years, there has been an increase in studies on the implications of gut microbiota (GM) on the behavior of children with ASD given that dysbiosis in GM may trigger the onset, development and progression of ASD through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. At the same time, significant progress has occurred in the development of artificial intelligence (AI).
Methods: The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of articles using AI to analyze GM in individuals with ASD. In line with the PRISMA model, 12 articles using AI to analyze GM in ASD were selected.
Results: Outcomes reveal that the majority of relevant studies on this topic have been conducted in China (33.3%) and Italy (25%), followed by the Netherlands (16.6%), Mexico (16.6%) and South Korea (8.3%).
Conclusions: The bacteria Bifidobacterium is the most relevant biomarker with regard to ASD. Although AI provides a very promising approach to data analysis, caution is needed to avoid the over-interpretation of preliminary findings. A first step must be taken to analyze GM in a representative general population and ASD samples in order to obtain a GM standard according to age, sex and country. Thus, more work is required to bridge the gap between AI in mental health research and clinical care in ASD.

Gut microbiota (GM), together with its metabolites (such as SCFA, tryptophan, dopamine, GABA, etc.), plays an important role in the functioning of the central nervous system. Various neurological and psychiatric disorders are associated with changes in the composition of GM and their metabolites, which puts them in the foreground as a potential adjuvant therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this relationship are not clear enough. Therefore, before considering beneficial microbes and/or their metabolites as potential therapeutics for brain disorders, the mechanisms underlying microbiota-host interactions must be identified and characterized in detail. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of GM alterations observed in prevalent neurological and psychiatric disorders, multiple sclerosis, major depressive disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorders, together with experimental evidence of their potential to improve patients' quality of life. We further discuss the main obstacles in the study of GM-host interactions and describe the state-of-the-art solution and trends in this field, namely ""culturomics"" which enables the culture and identification of novel bacteria that inhabit the human gut, and models of the gut and blood-brain barrier as well as the gut-brain axis based on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC derivatives, thus pursuing a personalized medicine agenda for neuropsychiatric disorders.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a multifactorial disorder involving genetic and environmental factors leading to pathophysiologic symptoms and comorbidities including neurodevelopmental disorders, anxiety, immune dysregulation, and gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities. Abnormal intestinal permeability has been reported among ASD patients and it is well established that disturbances in eating patterns may cause gut microbiome imbalance (i.e., dysbiosis). Therefore, studies focusing on the potential relationship between gut microbiota and ASD are emerging. We compared the intestinal bacteriome and mycobiome of a cohort of ASD subjects with their non-ASD siblings. Differences between ASD and non-ASD subjects include a significant decrease at the phylum level in Cyanobacteria (0.015% vs. 0.074%, p < 0.0003), and a significant decrease at the genus level in Bacteroides (28.3% vs. 36.8%, p < 0.03). Species-level analysis showed a significant decrease in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Prevotella copri, Bacteroides fragilis, and Akkermansia municiphila. Mycobiome analysis showed an increase in the fungal Ascomycota phylum (98.3% vs. 94%, p < 0.047) and an increase in Candida albicans (27.1% vs. 13.2%, p < 0.055). Multivariate analysis showed that organisms from the genus Delftia were predictive of an increased odds ratio of ASD, whereas decreases at the phylum level in Cyanobacteria and at the genus level in Azospirillum were associated with an increased odds ratio of ASD. We screened 24 probiotic organisms to identify strains that could alter the growth patterns of organisms identified as elevated within ASD subject samples. In a preliminary in vivo preclinical test, we challenged wild-type Balb/c mice with Delftia acidovorans (increased in ASD subjects) by oral gavage and compared changes in behavioral patterns to sham-treated controls. An in vitro biofilm assay was used to determine the ability of potentially beneficial microorganisms to alter the biofilm-forming patterns of Delftia acidovorans, as well as their ability to break down fiber. Downregulation of cyanobacteria (generally beneficial for inflammation and wound healing) combined with an increase in biofilm-forming species such as D. acidovorans suggests that ASD-related GI symptoms may result from decreases in beneficial organisms with a concomitant increase in potential pathogens, and that beneficial probiotics can be identified that counteract these changes.

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are crucial for neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Dysfunction of NMDARs is associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability. Understanding the impact of genetic variants of NMDAR subunits can shed light on the mechanisms of disease. Here, we characterized the functional implications of a de novo mutation of the GluN2A subunit (P1199Rfs*32) resulting in the truncation of the C-terminal domain. The variant was identified in a male patient with epileptic encephalopathy, multiple seizure types, severe aphasia, and neurobehavioral changes. Given the known role of the CTD in NMDAR trafficking, we examined changes in receptor localization and abundance at the postsynaptic membrane using a combination of molecular assays in heterologous cells and rat primary neuronal cultures. We observed that the GluN2A P1199Rfs*32-containing receptors traffic efficiently to the postsynaptic membrane but have increased extra-synaptic expression relative to WT GluN2A-containing NMDARs. Using in silico predictions, we hypothesized that the mutant would lose all PDZ interactions, except for the recycling protein Scribble1. Indeed, we observed impaired binding to the scaffolding protein postsynaptic protein-95 (PSD-95); however, we found the mutant interacts with Scribble1, which facilitates the recycling of both the mutant and the WT GluN2A. Finally, we found that neurons expressing GluN2A P1199Rfs*32 have fewer synapses and decreased spine density, indicating compromised synaptic transmission in these neurons. Overall, our data show that GluN2A P1199Rfs*32 is a loss-of-function variant with altered membrane localization in neurons and provide mechanistic insight into disease etiology.

Background: Depression is a heterogeneous disorder with high morbidity and disability rates that poses serious problems regarding mental health care. It is now well established that N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulators are being increasingly explored as potential therapeutic options for treating depression, although relatively little is known about their mechanisms of action. NMDARs are glutamate-gated ion channels that are ubiquitously expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), and they have been shown to play key roles in excitatory synaptic transmission. GluN2A, the predominant Glu2N subunit of functional NMDARs in neurons, is involved in various physiological processes in the CNS and is associated with diseases such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. However, the role of GluN2A in the pathophysiology of depression has not yet been elucidated.
Methods: We reviewed several past studies to better understand the function of GluN2A in depression. Additionally, we also summarized the pathogenesis of depression based on the regulation of GluN2A expression, particularly its interaction with neuroinflammation and neurogenesis, which has received considerable critical attention and is highly implicated in the onset of depression.
Results: These evidence suggests that GluN2A overexpression impairs structural and functional synaptic plasticity, which contributes to the development of depression. Consequently, this knowledge is vital for the development of selective antagonists targeting GluN2A subunits using pharmacological and molecular methods.
Conclusions: Specific inhibition of the GluN2A NMDAR subunit is resistant to chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors, making them promising targets for the development of novel antidepressants.

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors critical for synaptic transmission and plasticity, and for the development of neural circuits. Rare or de-novo variants in GRIN genes encoding NMDAR subunits have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, autism, schizophrenia, or epilepsy. In recent years, some disease-associated variants in GRIN genes have been characterized using recombinant receptors expressed in non-neuronal cells, and a few variants have also been studied in neuronal preparations or animal models. Here we review the current literature on the functional evaluation of human disease-associated variants in GRIN1, GRIN2A and GRIN2B genes at all levels of analysis. Focusing on the impact of different patient variants at the level of receptor function, we discuss effects on receptor agonist and co-agonist affinity, channel open probability, and receptor cell surface expression. We consider how such receptor-level functional information may be used to classify variants as gain-of-function or loss-of-function, and discuss the limitations of this classification at the synaptic, cellular, or system level. Together this work by many laboratories worldwide yields valuable insights into NMDAR structure and function, and represents significant progress in the effort to understand and treat GRIN disorders.

Monoclonal antibodies are powerful and versatile tools that enable the study of proteins in diverse contexts. They are often utilized to assist with identification of subcellular localization and characterization of the function of target proteins of interest. However, because there can be considerable sequence diversity between orthologous proteins in Xenopus and mammals, antibodies produced against mouse or human proteins often do not recognize Xenopus counterparts. To address this issue, we refined existing mouse monoclonal antibody production protocols to generate antibodies against Xenopus proteins of interest. Here, we describe several approaches for the generation of useful mouse anti-Xenopus antibodies to multiple Xenopus proteins and their validation in various experimental approaches.

We used mouse B16 melanoma to test the function of Adam11 in cancer cells, and published database analysis to study the expression of ADAM11 in human tumors. Results: Here we show that a non-proteolytic ADAM, Adam11, originally identified as a putative tumor suppressor binds to proteins of the Wnt and BMP4 signaling pathway. Mechanistic studies concerning these non-proteolytic ADAM lack almost entirely. We show that Adam11 positively regulates BMP4 signaling while negatively regulating β-catenin activity. In vivo, we show that Adam11 influences the timing of neural tube closure and the proliferation and migration of CNC. Using both human tumor data and mouse B16 melanoma cells, we further show that ADAM11 levels similarly correlate with Wnt or BMP4 activation levels. Discussion: We propose that ADAM11 preserves naïve cells by maintaining low Sox3 and Snail/Slug levels through stimulation of BMP4 and repression of Wnt signaling, while loss of ADAM11 results in increased Wnt signaling, increased proliferation and early epithelium to mesenchyme transition.

154,Inactive metallopeptidase homologs: the secret lives of pseudopeptidases,Peter J Lyons  1; ; ,"Abstract
Inactive enzyme homologs, or pseudoenzymes, are proteins, found within most enzyme families, that are incapable of performing catalysis. Rather than catalysis, they are involved in protein-protein interactions, sometimes regulating the activity of their active enzyme cousins, or scaffolding protein complexes. Pseudoenzymes found within metallopeptidase families likewise perform these functions. Pseudoenzymes within the M14 carboxypeptidase family interact with collagens within the extracellular space, while pseudopeptidase members of the M12 ""a disintegrin and metalloprotease"" (ADAM) family either discard their pseudopeptidase domains as unnecessary for their roles in sperm maturation or utilize surface loops to enable assembly of key complexes at neuronal synapses. Other metallopeptidase families contain pseudopeptidases involved in protein synthesis at the ribosome and protein import into organelles, sometimes using their pseudo-active sites for these interactions. Although the functions of these pseudopeptidases have been challenging to study, ongoing work is teasing out the secret lives of these proteins.

Septic cardiomyopathy (SCM), a complication initiated by sepsis, presents a significant clinical challenge, leading to increased mortality rates. However, the mechanisms of SCM have not been fully uncovered. Our study involved analyzing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from rat heart tissue, along with utilizing molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to discover key targets and potential pharmacological actions of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) against SCM. A lipopolysaccharide-induced SCM model was established in rats (LPS 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)). Thereafter, the myocardial tissues from the three groups of rats (Ctrl group, LPS group, and CGRP group) (n = 5) were extracted and underwent RNA-seq, followed by bioinformatics analyses. The qPCR-validated hub targets potentially interacting with CGRP were identified. Following this, homology modeling was utilized to obtain the 3D structure of hub targets, and molecular docking was conducted to evaluate the interaction between CGRP and hub targets. MD simulations (300 ns) were performed to confirm the findings further. Our findings demonstrated that CGRP significantly lowered mortality in SCM rats. 633 DEGs were affected by LPS, contrasted with the Ctrl group. 96 DEGs were affected by CGRP compared to the LPS group. In total, ten fully annotated CGRP-triggered hub genes were obtained. The molecular docking and MD simulations indicate that the relationship between CGRP and eight hub genes is extremely strong. This research offers a thorough examination of the possible objectives and fundamental molecular processes of CGRP in combating SCM, laying the groundwork for investigating the potential protective mechanisms of CGRP against SCM.

SoxB1 transcription factors (Sox2/3) are well known for their role in early neural fate specification in the embryo, but little is known about functional roles for SoxB1 factors in non-neural ectodermal cell types, such as the neural plate border (NPB). Using Xenopus laevis, we set out to determine whether SoxB1 transcription factors have a regulatory function in NPB formation. Here, we show that SoxB1 factors are necessary for NPB formation, and that prolonged SoxB1 factor activity blocks the transition from a NPB to a neural crest state. Using ChIP-seq, we demonstrate that Sox3 is enriched upstream of NPB genes in early NPB cells and in blastula stem cells. Depletion of SoxB1 factors in blastula stem cells results in downregulation of NPB genes. Finally, we identify Pou5f3 factors as potential Sox3 partners in regulating the formation of the NPB and show that their combined activity is needed for normal NPB gene expression. Together, these data identify a role for SoxB1 factors in the establishment and maintenance of the NPB, in part through partnership with Pou5f3 factors.

TRPM7 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 7) is a chanzyme with channel and kinase domains essential for embryo development. Using gamete-specific Trpm7-null lines, we report that TRPM7-mediated Mg2+ influx is indispensable for reaching the blastocyst stage. TRPM7 is expressed dynamically from gametes to blastocysts; displays stage-specific localization on the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus; and undergoes cleavage that produces C-terminal kinase fragments. TRPM7 underpins Mg2+ homeostasis, and excess Mg2+ but not Zn2+ or Ca2+ overcomes the arrest of Trpm7-null embryos; expressing Trpm7 mRNA restores development, but mutant versions fail or are partially rescued. Transcriptomic analyses of Trpm7-null embryos reveal an abundance of oxidative stress-pathway genes, confirmed by mitochondrial dysfunction, and a reduction in transcription factor networks essential for proliferation; Mg2+ supplementation corrects these defects. Hence, TRPM7 underpins Mg2+ homeostasis in preimplantation embryos, prevents oxidative stress, and promotes gene expression patterns necessary for developmental progression and cell-lineage specification.

Transient receptor potential channel subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) regulates cellular and systemic Mg2+ homeostasis through its channel domain and induces protein phosphorylation via its kinase domain. We recently found that mice with selective deletion of Trpm7 in β-cells develop glucose intolerance and declines in insulin secretion, primarily due to the impaired enzymatic activity of this protein. Accumulating evidence suggests that Mg2+ supplementation effectively mitigates the detrimental effects of TRPM7 disruption in various cell types. However, the impact of Mg2+ supplementation on metabolic impairments caused by TRPM7 inactivation remains unclear. In the present study, we found that Mg2+ supplementation significantly ameliorates glucose intolerance observed in high-fat-fed TRPM7 kinase-deficient mice (Trpm7R/R). However, our ex vivo analysis of islets isolated from Trpm7R/R mice revealed that Mg2+ supplementation does not enhance glucose-induced insulin secretion. Instead, the improvement appears to be partially driven by enhanced insulin sensitivity and increased β-cell proliferation. The pharmacological analysis in MIN6 cells showed that inhibiting TRPM7 with either NS8593 or VER155008 disrupts β-cell proliferation. These effects mimicked the phenotype seen in Trpm7R/R mice. We attribute this impairment to diminished ERK1/2 signaling, which suppressed PDX1 expression, while Mg2+ supplementation in vitro partially restored ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels. Collectively, Mg2+ supplementation enhances glucose metabolism in Trpm7R/R mice and mitigates the ERK1/2 signaling disruptions and proliferation arrest induced by TRPM7 inactivation in vitro. These findings provide compelling evidence that Mg2+ supplementation can reverse the adverse metabolic and cellular phenotypes associated with the loss of TRPM7 function.

Calcium (Ca2+) is a second messenger for many signal pathways, and changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) are an important signaling mechanism in the oocyte maturation, activation, fertilization, function regulation of granulosa and cumulus cells and offspring development. Ca2+ oscillations occur during oocyte maturation and fertilization, which are maintained by Ca2+ stores and extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]e). Abnormalities in Ca2+ signaling can affect the release of the first polar body, the first meiotic division, and chromosome and spindle morphology. Well-studied aspects of Ca2+ signaling in the oocyte are oocyte activation and fertilization. Oocyte activation, driven by sperm-specific phospholipase PLCζ, is initiated by concerted intracellular patterns of Ca2+ release, termed Ca2+ oscillations. Ca2+ oscillations persist for a long time during fertilization and are coordinately engaged by a variety of Ca2+ channels, pumps, regulatory proteins and their partners. Calcium signaling also regulates granulosa and cumulus cells' function, which further affects oocyte maturation and fertilization outcome. Clinically, there are several physical and chemical options for treating fertilization failure through oocyte activation. Additionally, various exogenous compounds or drugs can cause ovarian dysfunction and female infertility by inducing abnormal Ca2+ signaling or Ca2+ dyshomeostasis in oocytes and granulosa cells. Therefore, the reproductive health risks caused by adverse stresses should arouse our attention. This review will systematically summarize the latest research progress on the aforementioned aspects and propose further research directions on calcium signaling in female reproduction.

160,The TRPV3 channel is a mediator of zinc influx and homeostasis in murine oocytes,"Emily M Lopes  1   2 , ; Hiroki Akizawa  1   3 , ; Oguz C Koc  1   2 , ; Edgar Soto-Moreno  4 , ; Neha Gupta  1   5 , ; Goli Ardestani  1   6 , ; Ahmed Z Balboula  4 , ; Ingrid Carvacho  7 , ; Rafael A Fissore  1; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","Abstract
Zinc (Zn2+) homeostasis is essential for gametogenesis and reproduction, and its deficiency causes infertility. Oocytes contain higher Zn2+ levels than somatic cells, and Zn2+ concentrations in oocytes are far higher than those of other transition metals and increase even more during maturation in preparation for fertilization. Remarkably, it is unknown what transporter(s) or channel(s) mediate Zn2+ influx in oocytes and whether they are expressed uniformly throughout folliculogenesis. Here, we showed that the functional expression of a member of the transient receptor potential family, vanilloid 3, TRPV3, closely follows the dynamics of intracellular Zn2+ during oocyte maturation, raising the prospect that these events may be functionally linked. Using microfluorometry, we monitored in oocytes of Trpv3 null females the expected rise in Zn2+ concentrations during maturation. Surprisingly, Zn2+ levels did not climb, and the overall FluoZin3 signal in Trpv3 null eggs was lower than in control eggs. Electrophysiological recordings showed a large TRPV3 current induced by the agonist 2-APB in WT eggs supplemented with extracellular Zn2+ that was absent in Trpv3 null eggs; TRPV3 showed a clear preference for Zn2+ over Ca2+. Trpv3 null eggs displayed features associated with Zn2+ deficient conditions, such as lower IP3R1 function, abnormal cortical granule distribution, and disturbed cytoskeletal organization with distinct actin nucleation disorders. Notably, Trpv3 null eggs demonstrated undisturbed Zn2+ sparks. Our results suggest that TRPV3 is a pivotal member of the Zn2+ toolkit, mediating Zn2+ intake during maturation. They also indicate that distinct transporters or channels mediate Zn2+ influx throughout folliculogenesis.
